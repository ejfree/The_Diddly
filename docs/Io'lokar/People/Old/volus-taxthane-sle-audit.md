### Job:
Audit and Asset Recovery for Sivi’s Libation Emporium, located in Io’lokar.

---

### Personality:
Volus Taxthane is the epitome of bureaucratic precision—cold, exacting, and utterly unyielding. He views the world as a series of ledgers to be balanced, and he finds serenity in the symmetry of numbers and properly labeled crates. He rarely raises his voice, preferring the power of silence and expectation to cow subordinates into performance. His interactions are clipped and formulaic, often punctuated by phrases like, “Per my last correspondence,” and “That is an unacceptable variance.”

Volus sees himself not as a leader, but as the perfect instrument of his employer’s will. He holds a deep reverence—bordering on fear—for Sivi, and he channels that into relentless pursuit of efficiency and perfection. His current directive: locate the missing shipments of rare teas that Sivi personally requested. He has therefore “repurposed” this summer’s crop of interns as runners and errand drakes, putting them to task scouring manifests, interviewing cargo handlers, and (when desperate) taste-testing samples to ensure quality before delivery. To Volus, this is not petty work—it’s a sacred trust from his employer, and he treats it with all the solemnity of a religious rite.

### Description:
Volus is a towering specimen of blue dragonkind, with storm-blue scales etched by time and a faint aura of static electricity that lifts papers and singes the tips of quills. His frame is lean and powerful, his every movement sharp with mechanical precision. Twin horns curl like barbed lightning bolts from his brow, and his long tail is often seen tapping in slow, measured rhythms while he calculates potential discrepancies.

A floating arcane monocle hovers over his right eye, interfacing with a hovering dataslate that follows him everywhere—constantly updating audit reports, inventory counts, and intern failure rates. He wears a reinforced sash of filing tubes across his chest, each containing key documents bound in waterproofed silk.

Though he personally dislikes tea, he can recite the full classification chart of over 200 varieties—because Sivi expects it. His breath weapon may be lightning, but his real power lies in the way he says, “I’ll escalate this.”

### House:
Volus resides on the fourth level of Io’lokar, in a sleek, three-story Venetian-style townhouse tucked between a spice merchant’s guild and a quiet rune-printing press. His home is austere and spotless, the entryway filled with floating file cabinets and glass cases containing historical audits and correspondence. The second floor is a workspace with a central summoning circle—used not for magic, but for conjuring ledger spirits to cross-check numbers.

The third floor is a secure storage room with magically cooled drawers containing high-value documents, rare shipment receipts, and Sivi’s preferred tea leaves—once recovered. No guest has ever seen the private upper tier, but the interns often whisper of the day they might be sent up… and never return.
