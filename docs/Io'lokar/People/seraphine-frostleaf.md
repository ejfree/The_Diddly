### Seraphine Frostleaf

A silver‑scaled restorative alchemist whose remedies are as gentle as falling snow—and whose clinic discipline keeps Io’lokar’s small crises small.

### Appearance

Pale silver scales with a frosted edge to each plate; cool breath that smells faintly of mint and rain; a spotless apron with rune‑clean seams. Her horns carry tiny glass ampoules like jewelry.

### Personality

Warm bedside manner, clinical mind. Speaks softly and precisely; expects consent and comprehension before treatment. Humor shows as twinkling eyes and a perfectly timed kettle.

### Role and Duties

- Day job/mandate: Based at [Drake's Remedy](docs/Io'lokar/Locations/drakes-remedy.md).
- Authorities/responsibilities: Compounds tinctures and poultices, runs walk‑in triage, and maintains emergency kits for couriers and market wardens.
- University or weyr ties: Oversees apprentice rotations; consults on lab safety; supplies sanctioned reagents.

### Background

- Origin: Hatched to a line of midwives and field medics.
- Notable history: Led a relief tent during the Great Canopy Collapse; her burn‑salve formula saved countless wings.
- Education/training: Formal alchemy at the university; field practicums with Wardens and Couriers.

### Abilities and Resources

- Breath/Signature magic: Frost‑kiss breath that calms inflammation and preserves volatile reagents.
- Class/CR/Tier: Support specialist with high Medicine and Alchemy; steady in crisis.
- Skills/Strengths: Diagnosis by scent/temperature, cleanroom discipline, and supply chain savvy.
- Gear/Hoard highlights: Warded cold room, indexed antidote library, and a self‑stirring cauldron calibrated to breath output.

### Residences and Haunts

- Lair/Home description: A tidy loft over the dispensary with a winter herb garden under cool lamps.

### Hooks and Encounter Ideas

- Plot hook: A critical herb shipment is delayed; Seraphine hires the party to secure a substitute or stabilize patients another way.
- Social scene: Community clinic day where she teaches basic wound care and reagent respect.
- Complication: A recalled batch must be traced and retrieved before it interacts dangerously with a common tonic.

### Quotes

- "We cool the panic first, then the fever."
- "Clean tools, clear minds, kind hands."

### Variants

- Mood/time‑of‑day shift: Mornings for brewing; afternoons for walk‑ins; evenings for apprentices.
- Crisis/emergency mode: Snaps the shop into stations; breath keeps temps perfect while orders become clipped and calm.
- Planar alignment shift: Planar frost harmonizes with her breath, extending shelf‑life and making glass sing softly when a concoction reaches stability.
