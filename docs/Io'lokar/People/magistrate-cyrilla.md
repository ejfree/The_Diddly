### Magistrate Cyrilla

Io’lokar’s incisive Court dragon on the bench—Cyrilla turns facts into rulings with surgical clarity and a visible dislike for ornamented evasion.

### Appearance

Dark, lacquered scales that catch light like polished ink; horn‑tips capped in silver; a collar of simple writ‑rings. Her eyes linger on verbs.

### Personality

Reserved, direct, and fair. She values preparation, plain speech, and consequences that teach. Impatience flickers only when counsel wastes time.

### Role and Duties

- Day job/mandate: Based at [The Arbitration Spire](docs/Io'lokar/Locations/the-arbitration-spire.md).
- Authorities/responsibilities: Presides over civil hearings, issues writs and injunctions, and reviews settlements for enforceability and safety.
- University or weyr ties: Judges moot courts; mentors clinic cohorts with [Advocate Nen](advocate-nen.md) and [Mediator Faris](mediator-faris.md).

### Background

- Origin: From a lineage of record‑keepers who prized clean ledgers over long titles.
- Notable history: Authored the Plain Ruling Initiative that made decisions legible to non‑lawyers; dismissal rates for confusion dropped city‑wide.
- Education/training: Court dragon clerkships followed by a city‑wide rotation through market, guild, and portal disputes.

### Abilities and Resources

- Breath/Signature magic: A hush‑breath that dampens gallery noise and spotlights speakers; a binding exhale that temporarily affirms agreed terms.
- Class/CR/Tier: High‑tier adjudicator with exceptional Insight, Investigation, and Intimidation as needed.
- Skills/Strengths: Fact triage, pattern recognition, and crafting rulings that leave few escape hatches.
- Gear/Hoard highlights: Gavel‑sigil that starts session clocks; annotated casebook; a bell‑toll attuned to recess.

- Lair/Home description: Chambers on L2 with a modest perch‑garden and a wall of sealed precedents.
- Frequent locations: The Arbitration Spire; Io’lokar City Hall for inter‑office harmonization.
