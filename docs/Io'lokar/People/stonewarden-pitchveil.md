### Stonewarden Pitchveil

Bionic dragon foreman who ships fixes fast—parts, crews, and stubborn safety on schedule.

### Appearance

Stone‑scored scales with forged plates; a heavy tool belt; one eye set with a calm, steady lens.

### Personality

Brisk, fair, and allergic to excuses. Pitchveil respects clean work and clearer timelines.

### Role and Duties

- Authorities/responsibilities: Parts curation, dispatch, quotes, and final sign‑offs; runs recall drills when stock fails.
- University or weyr ties: Lends kits to workshops; partners with the Haven and Cindershod for standards.

### Background

- Origin: Tunnel works where corners killed; learned to measure twice and brace anyway.
- Notable history: Authored the city’s “three‑bolt truth” spec for temporary braces.
- Education/training: Smithing, rigging, and foremanship.

### Abilities and Resources

- Breath/Signature magic: Short, hard gusts that seat bolts and clear dust from lines.
- Class/CR/Tier: Artisan/logistics with Athletics, Investigation, and Intimidation (for deadlines).
- Skills/Strengths: Triage, quoting, and calling it straight.
- Gear/Hoard highlights: Dispatch board, tilt sensors, and brace kits.

### Residences and Haunts

### Hooks and Encounter Ideas

- Plot hook: A recall hits mid‑festival; Pitchveil needs neutral runners to swap unsafe parts quietly.
- Social scene: Shift‑change tea on the yard stairs—trade fix‑it war stories.
- Complication: A client demands a shortcut; hold the line on safety and keep the schedule.

### Secrets and Rumors

- ...

### Quotes

- "Brace it right or brace it twice."
- "We don’t sell speed. We sell certainty."

### Variants

- Mood/time‑of‑day shift: Dawn dispatch; midday site checks; dusk reconciles and recalls.
- Crisis/emergency mode: Lock the yard, open triage bays, and send brace teams first.
- Planar alignment shift: Weight feels odd; Pitchveil posts extra anchors and slower lifts.
