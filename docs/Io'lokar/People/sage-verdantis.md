### Sage Verdantis

An emerald knowledge‑smith who forges research into tools—turning questions into annotated maps, study kits, and field guides for those who must learn fast and well.

### Appearance

Faceted green scales like stacked book‑spines; frill tipped with brass page‑markers; ink‑stained talons. Spectacles hang from a chain of tiny clasps shaped like quotation marks.

### Personality

Patient, teasing, and relentlessly thorough. Verdantis delights in catalytic questions and treats every confusion like ore to be smelted into clarity. Dislikes gatekeeping and hoarding knowledge for status.

### Role and Duties

- Day job/mandate: Based at [Hoards of Knowledge](docs/Io'lokar/Locations/hoards-of-knowledge.md).
- Authorities/responsibilities: Designs custom study kits, memory‑palace charms, and annotated folios; curates a wall of public “cheats‑that‑teach.”
- University or weyr ties: Guest workshops on research synthesis; supplies lab notebooks and field slates to multiple colleges.

### Background

- Origin: Hatched in a scriptorium clutch that cataloged ruins; fell in love with the moment a learner “clicks.”
- Notable history: Their disaster‑prep pamphlets saved lives during a tower fire; later compiled into the Quick Concordance series.
- Education/training: Apprenticeship under an Emerald archivist; field work with expeditionary scholars and city first responders.

### Abilities and Resources

- Breath/Signature magic: A soft resonant hum that “indexes” spoken ideas, making key terms briefly glow on pages and minds.
- Class/CR/Tier: Support‑focused scholar with exceptional Investigation, Insight, and tool proficiencies.
- Skills/Strengths: Synthesis, teaching, patterning complex topics, and making safe beginner pathways.
- Gear/Hoard highlights: Self‑indexing folios, recall stones, and a wall of prototype study aids.

### Residences and Haunts

- Home level: L?
- Lair/Home description: A mezzanine loft over the shop lined with skylights and a tea bench; shelves hold “learning seeds” to sprout lesson plans overnight.
- Frequent locations: Hoards of Knowledge; Draconic Lecture Hub; The Scaled Scholar for guest critiques.
- Travel/transport habits: Walks with a satchel of samples; uses courier pickup for bulk orders.

- Social scene: A public “Study Sprint” night with tea and quiet encouragement that draws students, artisans, and a few nervous adventurers.
- Complication: A plagiarist undercuts Verdantis with dangerous shortcuts; evidence and pedagogy both matter to fix it.

### Quotes
