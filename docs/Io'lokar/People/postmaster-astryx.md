### Postmaster Astryx

Astral dragon postmaster who keeps Io’lokar’s mail on time and intact—slots, seals, and safe routes.

### Appearance

Starlight‑flecked scales; route‑stamp cord; ledger satchel; breath like paper, ink, and cool ozone.

### Personality

Brisk, kind, and exact. Astryx believes clear instructions and fair queues make miracles routine.

### Role and Duties

- Day job/mandate: Based at [The Planar Post](docs/Io'lokar/Locations/the-planar-post.md).
- Authorities/responsibilities: Route planning, portal‑window timing, seal checks, customs holds, and lost‑and‑found.
- University or weyr ties: Exam‑mail surge planning; safe protocols for research samples.

### Background

- Origin: Caravan posts and bell‑timed waystations.
- Notable history: Ended a chronic delay chain by retiming buffers and redrawing pad signage.
- Education/training: Logistics, portal safety, and restorative customer service.

### Abilities and Resources

- Breath/Signature magic: Astral drift‑sense breath that “pings” stable hops and calms wandering portals.
- Class/CR/Tier: Logistician/support with Insight, Investigation, and Vehicles (air/portal).
- Skills/Strengths: Queue design, timekeeping, and seal discipline.
- Gear/Hoard highlights: Seal chain, pad tokens, route bells, and a pocket kettle.

### Residences and Haunts

- Home level: L?
 - Lair/Home description: Modest loft over the pad office with a clock wall and tea tray.
 - Frequent locations: Planar Post pads; Aether Artery; Aegis Watchtower during drills.
 - Travel/transport habits: Walks counters; hops only on scheduled tokens.

### Hooks and Encounter Ideas

- Plot hook: A priority pouch vanishes during a drift hiccup; Astryx needs discreet couriers to reconstruct the route.
- Social scene: Queue tea at dusk—trade stories of near‑misses and perfect saves.
- Complication: A counterfeit stamp ring muddies custody; audit quietly without stopping the lines.

### Secrets and Rumors

- ...

### Quotes

- "Right token, right pad, right away."
- "Calm is the fastest route."

### Variants

- Mood/time‑of‑day shift: Morning sort and dispatch; midday customer windows; evening reconciles.
- Crisis/emergency mode: Hold unstable portals; reroute via couriers; medicine and registry first.
- Planar alignment shift: Long hops drift; stamp “alignment cautious” and widen buffers.

- Quick conversion/system notes for adjudication.
