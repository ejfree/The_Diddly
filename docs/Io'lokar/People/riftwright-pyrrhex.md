### Riftwright Pyrrhex

Phase‑tolerant artisan who builds and tests planar‑safe gear—prototypes that respect limits and keep people whole.

### Appearance

Smoky plates with interference colors at the edges; harness of test gauges; faint scent of ozone and oil.

### Personality

Curious, boundary‑respecting, and safety‑obsessed. Pyrrhex treats awe like a tool that needs guards.

### Role and Duties

 - Authorities/responsibilities: Designs, builds, and tests planar‑adjacent equipment; posts red lines; retires unsafe prototypes publicly.
 - University or weyr ties: Leads lab sections on “fail well” design.

### Background

 - Origin: Salvage crews along drift‑scar edges.
 - Notable history: Wrote the shop’s plain‑language hazard boards after a near miss.
 - Education/training: Materials science, flux behavior, and test protocol.

### Abilities and Resources

 - Breath/Signature magic: Phase blur that shows stress lines across dimensions.
 - Class/CR/Tier: Engineer/artisan; Arcana, Investigation, and Athletics.
 - Skills/Strengths: Test design, calm iteration, and honest postmortems.
 - Gear/Hoard highlights: Strain paints, tether lines, cutout charms, and kill‑switch rods.
