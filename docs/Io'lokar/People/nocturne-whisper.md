### Nocturne Whisper

Nightmare dragon curator of performances that feel like remembered dreams—and leave audiences kinder and braver than before.

### Appearance

Shadow‑soft scales that drink light; eyes like reflected candleflame; a collar of hush‑silk ribbons. Their voice seems to arrive already understood.

### Personality

Gentle, inviting, and piercingly insightful. Nocturne prefers questions to commands and edits with a single precise note.

### Role and Duties

- Authorities/responsibilities: Commissions, casts, and shapes performances; maintains hush‑wards; resolves audience incidents with care.
- University or weyr ties: Hosts masterclasses on memory and stage; collaborates with Allurienne Vox on caption craft.

### Background

- Origin: Story‑fires in a caravan of night guides.
- Notable history: Rewove a riotous crowd into a vigil with a single echo‑loop; the city remembers it as a turning point.
- Education/training: Glamour craft, restorative facilitation, and stage engineering.

### Abilities and Resources

- Breath/Signature magic: Dream‑breath that gently softens edges; echo‑threads that capture timbre without stealing words.
- Class/CR/Tier: Social/arcane hybrid with high Performance and Insight.
- Skills/Strengths: Audience reading, memory craft, and calm in crisis.
- Gear/Hoard highlights: Echo crystals, hush‑silk, and nightglass lenses.
