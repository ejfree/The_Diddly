### Cerulea Highline

An adventurous cerulean dragon who designs furniture that makes vertical city living graceful, safe, and beautiful—especially for mixed‑size households.

### Appearance

Sky‑blue scales with pale striations like wind over water; horn‑caps of brushed steel; a tool‑harness with foldout calipers and chalks. Resin scent and cedar cling to her.

### Personality

Enthused but precise. Cerulea loves constraints and will pepper clients with questions until the right solution emerges. She treats safety as part of beauty, not a compromise.

### Role and Duties

- Day job/mandate: Proprietor‑designer at [Skyline Furnishings](docs/Io'lokar/Locations/skyline-furnishings.md).
- Authorities/responsibilities: Site measurements, custom layouts, safety retrofits, and final flight‑check sign‑offs.
- University or weyr ties: Guest critic for design studios; consults on dorm retrofits and perch codes.

### Background

- Origin: Grew up in a cliff‑nest enclave where every ledge was earned and maintained.
- Notable history: Pioneered shock‑ground balcony anchors after a near‑miss in a student tower.
- Education/training: Apprenticed under a dwarven joiner and a storm‑touched metalworker; certified in city perch‑safety codes.

### Abilities and Resources

- Breath/Signature magic: A steady, cooling exhale that sets certain resins and calms vibrating spans during installs.
- Class/CR/Tier: Skilled artisan with high Tool proficiencies (woodcarver, smith, mason) and Investigation.
- Skills/Strengths: Load‑path intuition, mixed‑size ergonomics, and on‑site improvisation.
- Gear/Hoard highlights: Portable demo perch, shock‑ground bolts, foldout measuring rig keyed to portal pads.

### Residences and Haunts

- Home level: L1
- Lair/Home description: Loft above the shop filled with prototype parts and a sun‑warmed reading perch.
- Frequent locations: Skyline Furnishings; the lecture promenade; L2 retrofit sites.
- Travel/transport habits: Prefers short glides with tool harness; freight via portal pad.

### Hooks and Encounter Ideas

- Plot hook: A rival’s failing anchor injures a tenant; Cerulea needs neutral inspectors and fast repairs before panic spreads.
- Social scene: Open‑studio night where clients test new perch ideas and vote with colored tags.
- Complication: A batch of magnetized bolts disrupts compass wards; trace the supplier or demagnetize in the field.

### Secrets and Rumors

### Quotes

- "Safety is a style—we’re just honest about it."
- "Your nest should fit your breath, not fear it."

### Variants

- Mood/time‑of‑day shift: Mornings for measurements; afternoons for shop builds; evenings for installs.
- Crisis/emergency mode: Strips kits to essential parts and stabilizes sites first, aesthetics later.
- Planar alignment shift: Storm‑touched alloys sing softly, letting her hear overstressed spans.

- Quick conversion/system notes for adjudication.
