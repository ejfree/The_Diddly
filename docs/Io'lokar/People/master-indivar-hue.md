Havoc dragon painter who makes color behave—living murals and pigments that hold under breath and time.

### Hooks and Encounter Ideas

 - Plot hook: A mural’s living greens overgrow overnight; prune and reseal before it crowds a stairwell.

 - Complication: A cheap aerosol ruins a commission; mediate, repair, and post guidance.

### Secrets and Rumors

### Quotes

- "Color should be kind to eyes and walls."

### Variants

 - Mood/time‑of‑day shift: Morning tests; afternoon layers; evening glazes.
 - Crisis/emergency mode: Seal first, scrape safe, then rework.
