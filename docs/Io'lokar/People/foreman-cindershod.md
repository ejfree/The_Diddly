### Foreman Cindershod

An underworld dragon who makes unsafe spans safe—no fuss, no shortcuts, just solid work that holds.

### Appearance

Charcoal scales veined like basalt; ember‑bright eyes; leather apron scarred from sparks. His breath smells faintly of hot stone and resin.

### Personality

Blunt, fair, and practical. Cindershod likes plans that fit and bolts that bite. He respects anyone who shows up ready to work.

### Role and Duties

- Day job/mandate: Based at [Lair Essentials & Repairs](docs/Io'lokar/Locations/lair-essentials-and-repairs.md).
- Authorities/responsibilities: Site assessments, quotes, safety sign‑offs, and emergency stabilizations.
- University or weyr ties: Advises on dorm retrofits; partners with Skyline Furnishings on tricky installs.

### Background

- Origin: Tunnel‑nest clan where maintenance was survival.
- Notable history: Led the brace‑up during the Great Canopy Collapse; codified today’s shock‑ground spec.
- Education/training: Masonry, metalwork, and field rigging.

### Abilities and Resources

- Breath/Signature magic: Heat‑set breath that cures resins and reveals hairline cracks as glowing threads.
- Class/CR/Tier: Skilled artisan with high Athletics, Perception, and Tool (mason’s/smith’s).
- Skills/Strengths: Load‑path sense, emergency improvisation, and crew coordination.
- Gear/Hoard highlights: Shock‑ground bolt sets, foldout gantry, and a brace kit in a battered crate.

### Residences and Haunts

- Home level: L1
- Lair/Home description: A compact bay off the workshop with a cot and a wall of sample anchors.
- Frequent locations: The shop floor; retrofit sites; Skyline Furnishings for joint designs.
- Travel/transport habits: Walks or rides the freight pad; flies only when scouting.

### Quotes

- "A safe ledge is a beautiful ledge."

### Variants
