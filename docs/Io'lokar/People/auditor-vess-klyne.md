Bronze dragon evidence custodian whose clean chains and cooler head keep cases from falling apart.

### Hooks and Encounter Ideas

### Quotes

- "Facts first. Feelings later. Justice needs both."
- "If the chain is clean, the story can breathe."

### Variants

- Mood/time‑of‑day shift: Mornings favor intake audits and chain checks; afternoons handle viewing appointments; late evenings are for quiet reconciliations.
- Crisis/emergency mode: Lock the vault, freeze movements, and open a single intake lane; all items sleeved and logged before discussion.
- Planar alignment shift: Residual glamours film the air like oil; Vess’s breath shows tampering as a cold sheen.
