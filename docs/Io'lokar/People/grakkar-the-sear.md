### Grakkar the Sear

Red dragon who lives for the sizzle—feeds the city fast with bold, breath‑kissed plates.

### Appearance

Char‑dark scales with ember glints; leather apron; a breath‑ward collar he actually wears. Smells of smoke and citrus.

### Personality

Blunt, proud, and surprisingly kind to the hungry. Grakkar respects speed and hates waste.

### Role and Duties

- Authorities/responsibilities: Menu, grill, training line cooks, safety drills.
- University or weyr ties: Feeds festival crews; guest demos on safe breath finishes.

### Background

- Origin: Market fires and caravan grills.
- Notable history: Kept lines fed during the Great Canopy Collapse; set today’s grill safety bell cadence.
- Education/training: Kitchens, knife work, and ward design.

### Abilities and Resources

- Breath/Signature magic: Narrow, precise sear that caramelizes without smoke.
- Class/CR/Tier: Artisan/athlete with high Athletics and Cook’s Utensils.
- Skills/Strengths: Timing, line flow, and bulk flavor.
- Gear/Hoard highlights: Season stones, marked pans, and a bell set.
