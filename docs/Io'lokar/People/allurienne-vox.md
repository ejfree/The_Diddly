### Allurienne Vox

An alicorn dragon who turns scattered ideas into shareable moments—curating talks, rehearsals, and tools so voices carry clearly across Io’lokar.

### Appearance

Pearl‑sheened scales with opaline swirls; a light‑frame headset of etched crystal; wing‑membranes that shimmer like vellum. Scent of paper and ozone clings to her.

### Personality

Warm, focused, and curious. Allurienne believes every good idea deserves a fair stage. She trims logistics so speakers can breathe and listeners can learn.

### Role and Duties

- Day job/mandate: Based at [Draconic Lecture Hub](docs/Io'lokar/Locations/draconic-lecture-hub.md).
- Authorities/responsibilities: Booking, AV/resonance setup, caption crystal assignments, rehearsal coaching, and emergency “mic triage.”
- University or weyr ties: Coordinates with colleges and weyrs for visiting speakers; supports Advocate Nen’s plain‑speech clinics.

### Background

- Origin: Hatched to a librarian clutch that hosted story nights.
- Notable history: Salvaged a keynote during a storm by re‑routing power through portable pylons; recorded talks became the city’s first open lecture series.
- Education/training: Event craft, acoustic warding, and restorative facilitation.

### Abilities and Resources

- Breath/Signature magic: Resonance breath that evens out volume and clarity; briefly stabilizes overlapping voices for captions.
- Class/CR/Tier: Civic support specialist with high Performance, Persuasion, and Tool (tinkers) for AV rigs.
- Skills/Strengths: Stagecraft, schedule‑weaving, de‑escalation in crowded halls.
- Gear/Hoard highlights: Caption crystal set, portable pylons, and a checklist book that never leaves her side.

### Residences and Haunts

- Home level: L?
- Lair/Home description: Cozy loft near the promenade with a listening wall that replays room acoustics.
- Frequent locations: Lecture Hub halls; Hoards of Knowledge for study aids; The Tranquil Scale after late events.
- Travel/transport habits: Walks the promenade; short portal hops with gear crates when weather turns.

### Hooks and Encounter Ideas

- Plot hook: A caption crystal is missing; track it down or reconstruct a keynote before the bell.
- Social scene: Open‑mic debate with rotating prompts and gentle coaching.
- Complication: A rival venue poaches power from her pylons; find and fix the siphon mid‑event.

### Quotes

- "The right stage turns nerves into eloquence."
- "We don’t amplify volume—we amplify understanding."

### Variants
