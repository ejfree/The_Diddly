### Market Warden Selach

Sea‑schooled and stall‑savvy, Selach keeps the Draconic Market flowing—balancing vendors’ ambitions against the city’s standards with tides‑calm patience and sudden squalls for cheats.

### Appearance

Slate‑blue scales with a salt sheen and faint tide‑marks along the flanks; braided rope‑harness with stamped brass seals; eyes the green of deep harbors. He smells of brine and citrus oil used to polish the weigh‑stones.

### Personality

Pragmatic, even‑tempered until fairness tips—then sharp and fast. Speaks in currents and routes, favors short decisions over long speeches. Protective of first‑time sellers; merciless to counterfeiters.

### Role and Duties

- Day job/mandate: Based at [The Draconic Market](docs/Io'lokar/Locations/the-draconic-market.md).
- Authorities/responsibilities: Assigns stalls, audits weights and measures, issues day‑permits, and routes festival traffic. Oversees the Arbitration Table for on‑the‑spot disputes.
- University or weyr ties: Guest at commerce practicums; coordinates with City Hall for seasonal edicts and safety codes.

### Background

- Origin: Raised on a coastal waystation where markets lived and died by the tide chart.
- Notable history: Broke a counterfeit scale ring by swapping in true stones and watching who panicked. Wrote the Market Freshness Standard after a spoilage scare.
- Education/training: Trained under a Topaz registrar and a Brine courier captain; field time with Patrol Drakes.

### Abilities and Resources

- Breath/Signature magic: Brine‑spray breath that can reveal adulterated goods (spoiled oils curdle, salt‑cuts sting).
- Class/CR/Tier: Mid‑tier civic enforcer; strong Investigation and Insight; high Athletics in crowded lanes.
- Skills/Strengths: Weights and measures, crowd flow, lie‑scent, and vendor diplomacy.
- Gear/Hoard highlights: Calibrated weigh‑stones, seal‑stamps, a trident‑staff that marks queue lanes with a drag.

### Residences and Haunts

- Home level: L1
- Lair/Home description: A compact loft above the weigh‑house, with nets of sample goods and a wall of seized counterfeit labels.
- Frequent locations: The Draconic Market lanes; Frostfire Couriers’ cold‑dock; Io’lokar City Hall for code updates.
- Travel/transport habits: Walks the lanes at dawn; takes short glides to check canopies and wind flags before opening.
