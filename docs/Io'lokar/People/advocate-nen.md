### Advocate Nen

A lightning‑minded blue dragon who translates Io’lokar’s labyrinthine procedures into clear, survivable steps for ordinary petitioners—and makes institutional fairness executable.

### Appearance

Sleek sapphire scales etched with faint clause‑like sigils that glow when they’re thinking; horn‑edges hum with soft static; a chain of stamped writ‑seals hangs like a torque. Their scroll‑case is always dry despite weather, and their breath smells faintly of rain before a storm.

### Personality

Crisp, patient, and exacting. Nen prefers questions to statements and trims speeches down to verbs and obligations. They have a dry, defusing humor and an almost parental protectiveness toward first‑time petitioners. Grandstanding and deliberate ambiguity draw a visible twitch in their frill.

### Role and Duties

- Day job/mandate: Based at [The Arbitration Spire](docs/Io'lokar/Locations/the-arbitration-spire.md).
- Authorities/responsibilities: Runs the Intake Clinic, triages filings, coaches evidence prep, drafts clean writs and negotiated terms, and escorts vulnerable citizens through hearings.
- University or weyr ties: Guest lecturer on “Binding Language and Breath Safety” at the Draconic Lecture Hub; occasional workshops for City Hall clerks on plain‑speech rulings.

### Background

- Origin: Hatched to a courier‑law clutch that served off‑city enclaves; came to Io’lokar to “slow lightning down into law.”
- Notable history: Exposed a predatory arbitration ring by teaching petitioners to demand the right questions; wrote the Intake Charter now posted in the Spire’s atrium.
- Education/training: Apprenticed under a Court dragon magistrate; studied mnemonic clause‑weaving and oath‑safety wards.

### Abilities and Resources

- Breath/Signature magic: Forked lightning that can “underline” statements—harmlessly illuminating true clauses or arcing away from falsehoods.
- Class/CR/Tier: Mid‑tier civic advocate with strong social and investigative weights.
- Skills/Strengths: Procedure mastery, de‑escalation, evidence mapping, counter‑rhetoric, and clock‑management in crowded halls.
- Gear/Hoard highlights: Seal‑chain keyed to filing rooms, storm‑proof scroll‑case, self‑drying ink, and a quill that pricks only when a signer hesitates.

### Residences and Haunts

- Home level: L?
- Lair/Home description: A narrow L2 aerie lined with pigeonholes of precedents and “case‑maps” strung like constellations between shelving.
- Frequent locations: The Arbitration Spire (intake desk, gallery perches); Draconic Lecture Hub (guest seminars); The Crystal Pantry (bribes for overworked scribes).
- Travel/transport habits: Glides between towers when weather is fair; otherwise takes timed portal tokens to arrive exactly when bell‑chimes change.

### Hooks and Encounter Ideas

- Plot hook: Nen asks the party to retrieve a missing affidavit pouch from a courier waystation before a hearing clock expires.
- Social scene: A free clinic evening where Nen role‑plays hostile cross‑examination for nervous citizens and invites the party to play “difficult opposing counsel.”
- Complication: A hastily written settlement contains a poisonous clause; Nen needs help finding the original drafter—or undoing it in time.

### Quotes

- "We don’t need stronger voices—we need stronger verbs."
- "If it isn’t binding on you, it isn’t a promise from them."

### Variants

- Mood/time‑of‑day shift: After dusk they are gentler, turning clinics into tea‑and‑practice instead of drills.
- Crisis/emergency mode: Lightning tightens to a quiet glow; orders become single‑clause commands people can actually follow.
- Planar alignment shift: When storm‑planes press near, their breath etches temporary sigils in the air that highlight the safest procedural path.
