### Hooks and Encounter Ideas

- Plot hook: A premiere loses its concertmaster; Vell needs a dependable stand‑in and quick rehearsals.
- Social scene: Post‑show balcony tea—talk shop with artists and patrons.
- Complication: A glamour misfires during a scene change; keep the audience calm while crews reset.

### Secrets and Rumors

### Quotes

- "Cut the noise; keep the music."
- "We rehearse now so show‑night can breathe."

### Variants

- Mood/time‑of‑day shift: Mornings for score prep; afternoons for sectionals; evenings for full runs.
- Crisis/emergency mode: Reduce orchestration, simplify cues, and move to acoustic if the grid stutters.
- Planar alignment shift: Harmony thickens; sustained notes bloom while fast passages risk smearing without Vell’s cadence.
