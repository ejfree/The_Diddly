### Dispatcher Skadi Icevein

Phase dragon who keeps the city’s cold‑chain honest—routes tight, seals true, temp logs clean.

### Appearance

Pale steel‑blue scales with frost at the edges; seal‑punch at the belt; breath like mountain dawn. A pen dangles from a wrist cord.

### Personality

Cool, fair, and efficient. Skadi favors clarity and will quietly re‑do a route rather than argue theory.

### Role and Duties

- Day job/mandate: Based at [Frostfire Couriers](docs/Io'lokar/Locations/frostfire-couriers.md).
- Authorities/responsibilities: Intake triage, temp‑seal verification, route assignment, and drift alarm response.
- University or weyr ties: Coordinates market and lab deliveries; trains interns on cold‑chain safety.

### Background

- Origin: Ice vault caravans where one warm hour ruined weeks.
- Notable history: Broke a falsified log ring by tracking phase drift.
- Education/training: Logistics, portal anchoring, and preservation.

### Abilities and Resources

- Breath/Signature magic: Phase‑cool exhale that equalizes temperature without frostbite.
- Class/CR/Tier: Logistician with high Perception, Investigation, and Vehicles (air).
- Skills/Strengths: Temp discipline, seal checks, crisis calm.
- Gear/Hoard highlights: Seal‑punch, route bells, dewglass kit.

### Residences and Haunts

- Home level: L1
- Lair/Home description: Narrow loft above the bay with a kettle and a corkboard of routes.
- Frequent locations: Frostfire bay; Crystal Pantry; Luminous Larder.

### Hooks and Encounter Ideas

- Plot hook: A lab courier’s temp log goes blank mid‑route; Skadi needs discreet escorts to reconstruct the path before spoilage spreads.
- Social scene: Shift‑change tea at the bay—swap route tricks and cold‑chain tales.
- Complication: A drift alarm pings across three docks; triage, split tasks, and keep the line moving.

### Secrets and Rumors

- ...

### Quotes

- "Cold kept, trust kept."
- "Clarity first, speed second, pride never."

### Variants

- Mood/time‑of‑day shift: Pre‑dawn route builds; midday reroutes; dusk reconciles and audits.
- Crisis/emergency mode: Freeze nonessential runs; seal bays; priority lanes for medicine and perishables.
- Planar alignment shift: Phase drafts tug seals; Skadi’s breath evens temps and calms drift.
