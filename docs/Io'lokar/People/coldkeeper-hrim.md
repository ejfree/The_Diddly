### Coldkeeper Hrim

A meticulous white dragon who keeps Io’lokar’s food cold‑true—guardian of chill chains and honest weights.

### Appearance

Pale, frosted scales; a breath that condenses in neat curls; ice‑rimed whiskers. He wears a leather seal‑belt with stamped rings for every locker.

### Background
