### Mediator Faris

A gold dragon who turns grudges into agreements before they harden—sparing Io’lokar needless trials through carefully built apologies and balanced concessions.

### Appearance

Polished gold scales with soft, warm reflections; a minimal collar of accord beads that click once when both sides are truly listening. His smile is small and real.

### Personality

Empathic and exact. Faris listens until the heat drops, then speaks only the words a room can hold. Abhors victory laps; prizes durable outcomes over triumph.

### Role and Duties

- Day job/mandate: Based at [The Arbitration Spire](docs/Io'lokar/Locations/the-arbitration-spire.md).
- Authorities/responsibilities: Conducts pre‑hearing mediation, scripts apologies and amends, and drafts settlement frameworks for Writ Office review.
- University or weyr ties: Lectures on restorative practices; coaches the moot society alongside [Magistrate Cyrilla](magistrate-cyrilla.md).

### Background

- Origin: Hatched to a trade‑negotiator clutch; learned the price of pride early.
- Notable history: Ended a guild feud by swapping victories for shared credits; the accord still holds.
- Education/training: Mediator’s apprenticeship under a Gold matriarch; clerkship in the Writ Office to learn the teeth behind terms.

### Abilities and Resources

- Breath/Signature magic: A mellow heat that relaxes clenched jaws and slows speech to clarity; brief “mirror breath” reflects a speaker’s own words back with softened edges.
- Class/CR/Tier: Social specialist with strong Insight, Persuasion, and Deception checks when needed.
- Skills/Strengths: Apology architecture, face‑saving pathways, and concession pacing.
- Gear/Hoard highlights: Accord bead strands keyed to standard terms; a folding privacy screen that dampens gallery noise.

### Residences and Haunts

- Home level: L2
- Lair/Home description: Spare rooms on L2 near the Ombuds Hall; tea service always set, chairs sized for humanoids as well as dragons.
- Frequent locations: The Arbitration Spire mediation rooms; The Tranquil Scale for post‑session decompression; City Hall for filing follow‑ups.
- Travel/transport habits: Walks between adjacent towers; avoids dramatic entrances.

### Hooks and Encounter Ideas

- Plot hook: Faris needs neutral escorts to deliver a face‑saving gift that will unlock talks.
- Social scene: An evening “apology workshop” where role‑play gets uncomfortably real.
- Complication: One party seeks only delay; discovering that in time will save everyone pain.

### Quotes

- "We choose outcomes, or we choose to be right."
- "There’s always a third term hidden under the first two."

### Variants

- Mood/time‑of‑day shift: Mornings for intake prep with Nen; afternoons for shuttle mediations; nights for tea and notes.
- Crisis/emergency mode: Boils words down to verbs and trades; cuts off speeches with kindness.
- Planar alignment shift: When concordant planes brush close, accord beads glow gently when a balanced term is spoken.
