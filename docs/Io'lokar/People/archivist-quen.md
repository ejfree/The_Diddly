### Archivist Quen

Moonstone archivist who keeps the Theater’s scripts and scores legible—memory preserved, safely and with care.

### Appearance

Opaline moonstone plates that catch script‑light; fine dusting of silver ink along the claws; faint scent of vellum and cedar boxes.

### Personality

Soft‑spoken, meticulous, and protective of access. Quen pairs kindness with firm handling rules and delights in seeing a page used well.

### Role and Duties

 - Authorities/responsibilities: Catalogs scores and scripts, issues rehearsal copies, maintains humidity and light controls, and certifies premiere texts.
 - University or weyr ties: Hosts conservation practicums; guest demos on safe handling for stage crews.

### Background

 - Origin: Scriptorium clutch that archived caravan songs between towns.
 - Notable history: Salvaged a flood‑touched libretto with cold‑press and lunar drying.
 - Education/training: Binding, paper chemistry, and illusion‑proof watermarking.

### Abilities and Resources

 - Breath/Signature magic: Cool lunar breath that dries inks without bleed and reveals erased notes as pale glow.
 - Class/CR/Tier: Support/scholar with high History, Investigation, and Sleight of Hand.
 - Skills/Strengths: Conservation, indexing, provenance checks, and quiet leadership.
 - Gear/Hoard highlights: Humidity stones, press boards, cotton gloves, and calibrated lamps.
