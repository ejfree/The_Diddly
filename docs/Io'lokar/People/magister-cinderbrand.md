### Magister Cinderbrand

Magma dragon smith who bonds metal to meaning—runes that hold, gear that lasts, proofs you can trust.

### Appearance

Basalt scales with vein‑glow at the edges; apron scorched clean; rune chisel tucked like a pen.

### Personality

Direct, proud of good work, and allergic to mystique. Cinderbrand explains the why, then proves the what.

- Authorities/responsibilities: Specs, quotes, forging, inlay, and proof logs; safety upgrades prioritized.
- University or weyr ties: Teaches runework basics; consults for stage and lab builds.

### Background

- Origin: Caravan forges and shrine fittings.
- Notable history: Coined the Cinderbrand Bond after a bridge span held through a drift.
- Education/training: Smithing, runes, and ethics of enchantment.

### Abilities and Resources

- Breath/Signature magic: Steady magma breath for clean heat; ember‑spit that marks true seams.
- Class/CR/Tier: Artisan with Athletics, Arcana, and Investigation.
- Skills/Strengths: Load paths, clean inlays, and fair quotes.
- Gear/Hoard highlights: Rune kit, proof plates, and a trusted hammer.

### Hooks and Encounter Ideas

### Quotes

- "Proof beats promise."

### Variants
