### Alembic Gloomveil

An underworld dragon who treats alchemy like public safety—precise, patient, and proud of clean benches and clean consciences.

### Appearance

Basalt‑dark scales with a glassy sheen; horn‑rings etched with measurement marks; apron neatly scored with safe zones. Breath leaves a shimmer that settles evenly.

### Personality

Soft‑spoken, exact, and stubborn about safety. Humor is dry as desiccant. Celebrates small, repeatable successes over flashy breakthroughs.

### Role and Duties

- Day job/mandate: Based at [The Alchemist’s Corner](docs/Io'lokar/Locations/the-alchemists-corner.md).
- Authorities/responsibilities: Certifies benches, compounds custom orders, audits student kits, and runs the neutralizer hatch.
- University or weyr ties: Teaches “lab etiquette and breath discipline” modules; consults with Seraphine Frostleaf on antidote stability.

### Background

- Origin: Mine‑nest upbringing where fumes killed the careless.
- Notable history: Tracked a string of minor mishaps to mislabeled student kits; rewrote the standard labels.
- Education/training: Apprenticed under a void‑glass maker and a civic alchemist; certification in hazardous waste protocols.

### Abilities and Resources

- Breath/Signature magic: Heat‑evening exhale that stabilizes temperature drift; “fog check” breath to test hood flow.
- Class/CR/Tier: Artisan with high Medicine, Nature, and Tool (alchemist’s supplies).
- Skills/Strengths: Process control, label clarity, steady claws.
- Gear/Hoard highlights: Certified glass, calibrated droppers, and a personal logbook of safe recipes.

### Residences and Haunts

- Home level: L1
- Lair/Home description: Small, cool loft over the shop; sparse, organized, and labeled.
- Frequent locations: The Alchemist’s Corner; Drake’s Remedy; university labs during audits.
- Travel/transport habits: Walks with a secure kit; avoids crowded festival lanes.

### Hooks and Encounter Ideas

- Plot hook: A mislabeled vial must be found before class; Alembic needs runners with good noses.
- Social scene: Quiet “open bench” evening swapping safe process hacks.
- Complication: A supplier’s batch fails purity tests; trace contamination source.

### Secrets and Rumors

### Quotes

- "Pretty reactions are for festivals; ours are for lives."
- "Label twice, brew once."

### Variants

- Mood/time‑of‑day shift: Patient mornings; brisk afternoons; meticulous nights.
- Crisis/emergency mode: Triage, neutralize, ventilate—then investigate.
- Planar alignment shift: Breath fog patterns reveal weak hood flow.

### Stat Block Notes (Optional)

- Quick conversion/system notes for adjudication.

### GM Notes
