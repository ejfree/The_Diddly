Campus nerve‑center for talks, debates, and study support—scheduling, lecture capture, and rehearsal space that keeps ideas airborne and accessible.

### Location Details

- Exterior/signage: Banner‑sigils that update daily topics; a crystal marquee that scrolls the day’s schedule.

### Services and Offerings

- Rehearsal rooms with breath‑baffling for safe practice
- Study pods, debate coaching, and speaker prep
- Loaner scribe stones for note capture

### Atmosphere and Layout

- Vibe and sensory notes: Chalk, tea, copper and ozone from AV pylons; a soft murmur of practiced rhetoric
- Capacity/scale: Mixed sizes with tiered galleries and low desks; exterior perches for overflow
- Seating/flow: Help desk → booking alcoves → rehearsal/lecture rooms
- Map/layout notes: Street entrance, help counter, pod corridor, main hall, equipment cage

### Staff and NPCs

- Owner/Manager: [Allurienne Vox](../People/allurienne-vox.md) (Alicorn dragon), inspiring lecture coordinator.
- Key staff:
  - Shop Golem (non-sentient), handles lifting, cleaning, simple tasks via chime/gesture.
  - Ledger Automaton (non-sentient), stamps receipts and tracks stock.
  - Bound Elemental (non-sentient), provides heat/cold/air/light as needed.
- Ties to university or weyrs: Serves dragon-run facilities; deliveries via Draconian Couriers or Frostfire Couriers.

### Mechanics and Rules

- House rules (behavior, breath, magic): Quiet in pods; no unsupervised breath effects on stages; cite sources when using scribe stones
- Ordering/service flow (e.g., counter, portal chute, omakase): Check‑in → reserve → rehearsal/recording → export
- Hazards/environmental notes: Resonance pylons can induce feedback if misaligned

### Security and Wards

- Protections/alarms: Feedback limiters and hush‑wards between rooms
- Wards/anti‑theft: Tagged caption crystals; equipment cage keyed to staff
- Portal anchors/safeties: Short‑hop pads for visiting speakers and gear

### Hooks and Encounters

- Plot hook: A keynote’s caption crystal is missing; reconstruct the talk or retrieve it before the crowd turns restless
- Social scene: Open‑mic debate night hosted by [Allurienne Vox](../People/allurienne-vox.md)
- Complication: Resonance pylons start cross‑linking two talks; trace the interference source fast
