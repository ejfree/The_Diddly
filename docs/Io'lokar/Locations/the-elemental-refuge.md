### The Elemental Refuge

Custom lair environments—cloud perches, mist veils, ember‑safe nooks, and water‑calm pools tuned to your breath and habits.

### Location Details

- Level: L1
- District/adjacency: Workshop row beside Skyline Furnishings and Lair Essentials.
- Exterior/signage: A swirling cloud over a perch; breeze‑ribbons that move even on still days.

### Services and Offerings

- Environmental installs: cloud perches, mist curtains, breeze lanes, lighting
- Breath‑safe liners and heat‑tolerant surfaces
- Humidity/airflow balancing for mixed‑species households
- Site surveys and post‑install tune‑ups

### Signature Items or Specialties

- Hours: Late morning to evening; installs by appointment
- Entry/reservations: Walk‑in consults; site visits by token
- Discounts: student | faculty | weyr members

### Atmosphere and Layout

- Vibe and sensory notes: Clean air, cedar, and a faint coolness; demo breezes whisper through chimes
- Capacity/scale: Mixed sizes; demo perches and a mock lair corner
- Seating/flow: Consultation desk, materials wall, demo bay
- Map/layout notes: Front entrance, consult, demo floor, warehouse, loading pad

### Staff and NPCs

- Owner/Manager: [Warden Cloudwhorl](../People/warden-cloudwhorl.md) (Cloud dragon), airy lair customizer.
- Key staff:
  - Mason Golem (non-sentient), cut/fit stone and metal.

  - Measure Automaton (non-sentient), spans and templates.
- Ties to university or weyrs: Serves dragon-run facilities; deliveries via Draconian Couriers or Frostfire Couriers.

### Mechanics and Rules

- House rules (behavior, breath, magic): Test breaths only at the demo bay; no open flames near veils
- Ordering/service flow (e.g., counter, portal chute, omakase): Consult → survey → design → install → tune‑up
- Hazards/environmental notes: Slip risk near mist demos; marked lanes

### Security and Wards

- Protections/alarms: Breeze alarms on night entry; tilt sensors on demo perches
- Wards/anti‑theft: Tag‑runes on high‑value anchors
- Portal anchors/safeties: Staff pad keyed to warehouse only

### Hooks and Encounters

- Plot hook: A tenant’s perch fails inspection; [Warden Cloudwhorl](../People/warden-cloudwhorl.md) needs quick reinforcement before sunset.
- Social scene: Open‑house demo where neighbors compare lair upgrades and tips.
- Complication: An over‑eager buyer insists on unsafe cooling veils; convince or retrofit.
