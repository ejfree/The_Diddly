### Mechanics and Rules

- House rules (behavior, breath, magic): No loose breath; eye/ear protection past the line
- Ordering/service flow (e.g., counter, portal chute, omakase): Spec → quote → forge → inlay → proof

- Wards/anti‑theft: Maker’s runes; vault for completed commissions

### Hooks and Encounters

- Social scene: Commission night—clients trade specs and recommendations.
- Complication: A counter‑rune causes drift; find and replace before a show.
