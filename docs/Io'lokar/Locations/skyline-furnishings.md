### Skyline Furnishings

Dragon‑scale interior design and modular furnishings that make vertical living elegant—custom perches, glide‑safe shelving, and harness‑compatible fixtures.

### Location Details

- Level: L1
- District/adjacency: Cliff‑lane just off the lecture hub promenade; easy glide‑in with portal pad at the rear for freight.
- Exterior/signage: A stylized skyline of perches and balconies in cerulean enamel; rotating display shows a perch unfolding mid‑air.

### Services and Offerings

- - Custom perches (folding, heated, ward‑ready)
- - Modular shelving rated for hoards and lab gear
- - Harness‑mount anchors for tools and instruments
- - Consultation and in‑home fitting for mixed‑size households

### Signature Items or Specialties

- - “Cloudstep” folding balcony‑perch (silent hinges; shock‑grounded)
- - “Hoard‑Nest” drawer clusters with anti‑slide lips and fire‑tolerant liners

### Pricing and Access

- Price tier: cheap | moderate | upscale | luxury
- Hours: Late morning to late evening; installation crews by appointment
- Entry/reservations: Walk‑ins welcome; design consults scheduled; portal demo by request
- Discounts: student | faculty | weyr members

### Atmosphere and Layout

- - Vibe and sensory notes: Cedar and beeswax; quiet click of precision joinery; soft breeze through glide‑doors
- - Capacity/scale: Mixed sizes with test‑perches for large frames and mock apartments for humanoids
- - Seating/flow: Consultation alcoves, demo rigs, material wall, rear install bay
- - Map/layout notes: Street entrance, design counter, demo floor, back warehouse with portal pad

### Staff and NPCs

- Owner/Manager: [Cerulea Highline](../People/cerulea-highline.md) (Cerulean dragon), adventurous designer.
- Key staff:
  - Lift Golem (non-sentient), move and place large pieces.
  - Earth Elemental (non-sentient), stabilization and leveling.
  - Polisher Automaton (non-sentient), finish work and sheen.
- Ties to university or weyrs: Serves dragon-run facilities; deliveries via Draconian Couriers or Frostfire Couriers.

### Mechanics and Rules

- - House rules (behavior, breath, magic): No aggressive breath near finishes; flight demos with a handler only
- - Ordering/service flow (e.g., counter, portal chute, omakase): Browse → measure → consult → fabricate → install
- - Hazards/environmental notes: Lift Golem lanes marked on the floor; please do not perch on unsecured prototypes

### Security and Wards

- - Protections/alarms: Weight‑sensors and tilt alarms on displays; bell‑wards after hours
- - Wards/anti‑theft: Tag‑runes that blur stolen items’ edges to uncomfortably visible shimmer
- - Portal anchors/safeties: Anchored demo pad; freight portal keyed to warehouse only

### Hooks and Encounters

- - Plot hook: A failed balcony anchor from a rival shop prompts emergency inspections across a block—help triage and repair before nightfall.
- - Social scene: Design night where artisans and dragons test new perch concepts; excellent for favors and introductions.
- - Complication: A shipment of shock‑ground bolts arrives magnetized; trace the fault or improvise safe installs.
