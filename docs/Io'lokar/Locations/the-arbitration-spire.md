### The Arbitration Spire

Io’lokar’s civil dispute tower—neutral ground where agreements are forged, writs are issued, and frightened citizens find their way through procedure.

### Function and Purpose

- Core mandate/services: Civil arbitration, injunctions, oath‑binding for testimony, and the drafting/registration of concords and writs. The ground‑level Intake Clinic (run day‑to‑day by [Advocate Nen](../People/advocate-nen.md)) turns tangled problems into processable filings.
- Audience/users: residents | students | faculty | visitors
- Jurisdiction/scope: Non‑criminal disputes between citizens, guilds, and visiting delegations; criminal matters are referred to City Hall courts.

### Location Details

- Level: L2
- District/adjacency: Between Io’lokar City Hall and the Draconic Market’s upper courts, with glide‑lanes marked by bell‑chimes.
- Exterior/architecture: A faceted spiral of pale stone and blue glass sigils; balcony‑perches ring each hearing level like scales.

### Interior and Layout

- Notable areas/rooms: Intake Clinic (public desks coached by Nen), Bench of Equity chambers, Concord suites, Writ Office counters, Ombuds Hall, and a sound‑damped gallery for observers.
- Capacity/scale: Four active hearing rooms at once; standing room on galleries; overflow opens to lecture halls during festivals.
- Accessibility (flight, ramps, portals): Broad ramps coil the core; lift‑platforms and timed portal alcoves serve non‑fliers; exterior perches allow direct balcony entry.

### Operations

- Hours/open access: Dawn‑to‑dusk for filings and clinics; hearings continue past dark on bell‑schedule.
- Procedures/queues/permits: Queue tokens issued by Record Golems; pro se petitioners may claim a free clinic slot; oath‑binding requires two witnesses or a clerk.
- Dependencies (couriers, portals, guard): Contracted courier flights, portal relays to City Hall archives, and Wardens on call for high‑tension sessions.

### Staff and Roles

- Steward/Head: [Magistrate Cyrilla](../People/magistrate-cyrilla.md) (Court dragon), incisive arbiter of disputes.
- Departments/units:
  - Bench of Equity (Emerald dragon, 1), inquisitive reviewer who tests claims for truth and context.
  - Concord Guild (Sovereign dragon, 1), high‑stakes negotiator for binding agreements.
  - Writ Office (Edict dragon, 1), issues rulings, injunctions, and binding terms.
  - Ombuds Hall (Moonstone dragon, 1), gentles fraught emotions and preserves narratives.
  - Support constructs: Record Golems transcribe; Bell‑Toll Elementals signal session phases.
- Key contacts:
  - [Advocate Nen](../People/advocate-nen.md) (Blue dragon), procedure and filings coach for petitioners.
  - [Mediator Faris](../People/mediator-faris.md) (Gold dragon), pre‑hearing settlements and apologies.

### Magic, Wards, and Infrastructure

- Standing effects/wards: Truth‑resonance lattice softly amplifies clarity and dampens disruptive magic; oath‑rings inscribe temporary glyphs on sworn statements.
- Safety systems/failsafes: Breath‑dampers and shock‑grounds redirect errant discharges; emergency shutters isolate chambers without sealing exits.
- Power/portal anchors: Blue‑sigil conduits carry charge between bells; anchored portals link to archives and the evidence locker.

### Hooks and Encounters

- Plot hook: A courier pouch of affidavits vanishes en route; a hearing clock is ticking and Nen recruits the party to fix the gap before a default ruling.
- Procedural obstacle: The party’s writ lacks a counter‑sign; they must persuade a wary clerk or assemble a substitute affidavit under time pressure.
- Social opportunity: Post‑concord receptions on the gallery—excellent for introductions, favors, and quiet apologies.

### Variants

- Peak activity mode: Festival seasons bring a surge in vendor disputes; clinics extend to the outer steps with pop‑up desks.
- Crisis/emergency mode: Chambers rotate to triage compensation and temporary accords; Nen’s clinic converts to a rapid‑response drafting line.
- Planar alignment shift: When storm‑planes press close, oath‑rings spark visibly and truth‑resonance can be read as gentle blue underlines.

### GM Notes

- Adjudication aids, DCs, complication clocks, consequence ladders.
