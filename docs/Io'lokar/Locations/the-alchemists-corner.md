### The Alchemist’s Corner

Precision brews and safe experiments—custom reagents, rental benches, and expert oversight for students and professionals.

### Location Details

- Exterior/signage: Retort and coil sigil in matte black; windows fog and clear in measured pulses.

### Services and Offerings

- Bench rentals with fume control and certified glass
- Custom compounding, titration, and assay services
- Safe disposal and neutralization of spent reagents
- Starter kits for coursework with city‑approved recipes

### Signature Items or Specialties

- Breath‑buffer tonics for safe practice near volatile mixes
- Under‑light elixirs that reveal trace contaminants

### Pricing and Access

- Price tier: cheap | moderate | upscale | luxury
- Hours: From late morning to late evening; extended during exam weeks
- Entry/reservations: Walk‑ins for purchases; benches by token; ID check for restricted reagents
- Discounts: student | faculty | weyr members

### Atmosphere and Layout

- Vibe and sensory notes: Clean alcohol, citrus, and faint ozone; steady drip and low condenser hum
- Capacity/scale: Mixed sizes; high bays for dragon benches, low alcoves for humanoid stations
- Seating/flow: Counter → kit wall → bench corridor → waste window
- Map/layout notes: Street entrance, consultation counter, rental bays, back compounding room, neutralization nook

### Staff and NPCs

- Owner/Manager: [Alembic Gloomveil](../People/alembic-gloomveil.md) (Underworld dragon), meticulous alchemist.
- Key staff:
  - Retort Golem (non-sentient), holds glass and coiling.
  - Vapor Elemental (non-sentient), fume hood flows.
  - Measure Automaton (non-sentient), scrupulous volumetrics.
- Ties to university or weyrs: Serves dragon-run facilities; deliveries via Draconian Couriers or Frostfire Couriers.

### Mechanics and Rules

- House rules (behavior, breath, magic): Goggles on past the line; no free‑casting; breath only in baffled bays
- Ordering/service flow (e.g., counter, portal chute, omakase): Consult → kit/bench → compound → neutralize → sign off
- Hazards/environmental notes: Heat marks the red zone; waste passes through the neutralizer hatch only

### Security and Wards

- Protections/alarms: Vapor alarms and pressure pop‑bells; spill sand at every bench
- Wards/anti‑theft: Tag‑runes on rare reagents; glass that fogs opaque if stolen
- Portal anchors/safeties: Anchored pad for bulk deliveries; drift shutters on vents

### Hooks and Encounters

- Plot hook: A lab accident elsewhere needs neutralizer drums; [Alembic Gloomveil](../People/alembic-gloomveil.md) recruits swift hands
- Social scene: Open bench night where students share safe hacks
- Complication: A mislabeled vial circulates; trace and correct before a class assessment
