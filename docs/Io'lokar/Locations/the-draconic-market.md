### The Draconic Market

Io’lokar’s open‑air bazaar: fresh provisions, artisan goods, and roaring festival lanes kept fair and flowing under watchful draconic eyes.

### Function and Purpose

- Core mandate/services: Daily stalls for food, tools, and curios; festival courts; weights‑and‑measures enforcement; on‑site arbitration for merchant disputes.
- Audience/users: residents | students | faculty | visitors
- Jurisdiction/scope: Vendor licensing, sanitation standards, and stall assignments for the L1 market district.

### Location Details

- Level: L1
- District/adjacency: Between courier depots and the festival green; alleys feed into tasting rows and craft courts.
- Exterior/architecture: Color‑striped canopies and wind‑flags; weigh‑houses and bell‑chimes mark the main lanes.

### Interior and Layout

- Notable areas/rooms: Weigh‑house, Arbitration Table, cold‑chain lanes, tasting alley, festival square.
- Capacity/scale: Hundreds of rotating stalls with perch‑ridges overhead; overflow during festivals.
- Accessibility (flight, ramps, portals): Wide lanes with low hazards; glide‑perches above; portal chutes for deliveries.

### Operations

- Hours/open access: Dawn to dusk; festival hours extend by bell.
- Procedures/queues/permits: Queue tokens for scales and stalls; day‑permits at the Warden’s desk; immediate arbitration available.
- Dependencies (couriers, portals, guard): Frostfire and Draconian Couriers; Breeze Elementals for air quality; Patrol Drakes for security.

### Staff and Roles

- Steward/Head: [Market Warden Selach](../People/market-warden-selach.md) (Sea dragon), fickle but fair master of stalls and routes.
- Departments/units:
  - Stallmasters (Green dragons, 2), enforce weights, measures, and sanitation.
  - Patrol Drakes (Black dragon, 1), prowls for thieves and counterfeiters.
  - Festival Office (Vermillion dragon, 1), schedules fairs and food courts.
  - Arbitration Table (Court dragon, 1), settles merchant disputes on the spot.
  - Support constructs: Scale Golems and Breeze Elementals keep air moving and queues tidy.
- Key contacts:
  - [Harbormark Sedge](../People/harbormark-sedge.md) (Brine dragon), inbound provisions and cold‑chain lanes.
  - [Tallier Prism](../People/tallier-prism.md) (Crystal dragon), rent rolls and stall assignments.

### Magic, Wards, and Infrastructure

- Standing effects/wards: Anti‑counterfeit sigils at the weigh‑house; freshness markers along cold lanes.
- Safety systems/failsafes: Spillway gutters; shock‑grounded poles near breath‑cooking stalls.
- Power/portal anchors: Beacon chimes guide portal drops to safe pads.

### Hooks and Encounters

- Plot hook: A cold‑chain lane collapses; perishables will spoil without a fast reroute.
- Procedural obstacle: A permit audit flags the party’s pop‑up stall; prove compliance or fix faults on the fly.
- Social opportunity: Tasting alley showcase featuring new vendors—excellent for contacts and favors.
