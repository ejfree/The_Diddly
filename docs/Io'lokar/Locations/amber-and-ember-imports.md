### Staff and NPCs

- Owner/Manager: [Embercoil of Anbar](../People/embercoil-of-anbar.md) (brass dragon), proprietor and buyer. Personally oversees the ember‑kilns and negotiates imports; prefers a lean, hands‑on operation.
- Key staff:
  - Brass‑Bell Kiln Golem (non‑sentient), heat‑regulated loader/roaster for spices and ambered fruits; follows simple rung‑chime commands.
  - Amber‑Ledger Automaton (non‑sentient), bead‑counter and label stamper; tracks lots and reorder marks.
  - Ember‑Wisp (tiny fire elemental, non‑sentient), bound heat source for curing trays; glows brighter when temperatures drift.
- Ties to university or weyrs: Supplies dragon‑run kitchens (incl. The Ember Hearth) and faculty hoard‑pantries; Frostfire Couriers handle most scheduled runs.

### Mechanics and Rules

- House rules (behavior, breath, magic): No open breath outside the demo bay; respect heat markers
- Ordering/service flow (e.g., counter, portal chute, omakase): Taste → select → contract → deliver
- Hazards/environmental notes: Hot surfaces; clear tail lanes near kilns

### Security and Wards

- Protections/alarms: Heat drift alarms; bell on back door
- Wards/anti‑theft: Tag‑runes on high‑value spice lots and kilns
- Portal anchors/safeties: Staff pad for freight; demo bay isolated

### Hooks and Encounters

- Plot hook: A rare spice lot stalls in customs; help [Embercoil of Anbar](../People/embercoil-of-anbar.md) secure release.
- Social scene: Chef and smith tasting night—alliances born over heat.
- Complication: A knockoff kiln risks backdraft; identify and recall.
