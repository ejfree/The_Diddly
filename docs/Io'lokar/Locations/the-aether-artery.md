### The Aether Artery

Primary portal thoroughfare for the district—timed passages, safe handoffs, and calm flow during alignments.

### Function and Purpose

- Core mandate/services: Schedule, meter, and stabilize civic portal traffic; open surge lanes during festivals; route around drift and outages.
- Audience/users: residents | students | faculty | visitors
- Jurisdiction/scope: District portals and waybeacons; coordinates with Portal Nexus for city‑wide shifts.

### Location Details

- Level: L1
- District/adjacency: Between the Lecture Hub and the Market; sightlines to the Nexus beacons.
- Exterior/architecture: Ribbed arcades with inset waygates; bell‑towers mark cadence.

### Interior and Layout

- Notable areas/rooms: Meter Hall, Drift Desk, Surge Lane, and Quiet Queue for first‑timers.
- Capacity/scale: Multiple gate pairs; overflow corridors open during alignment lifts.
- Accessibility (flight, ramps, portals): Broad ramps and glide lanes; short‑hop pads for staff.

### Operations

- Hours/open access: Bell to bell; surges on posted intervals; after‑hours by clearance.
- Procedures/queues/permits: Token timeslots; first‑time briefings; cargo declarations at Meter Hall.
- Dependencies (couriers, portals, guard): Couriers on call; Aegis Watch for incident response.

### Staff and Roles

- Steward/Head: [Conductor Celene](../People/conductor-celene.md) (Lunar dragon), oversees arterial flow during alignments.
- Departments/units:
  - Pulse Wardens (Time dragon, 1), cadence control for surges and slowdowns.
  - Vein Survey (Cerulean dragon, 1), scouting alternate paths and spurs.
  - Harmonicists (Havoc dragon, 1), intentional resonance to smooth rough crossings.
  - Counterflux (Occult dragon, 1), cancels oscillations and siphons.
  - Support constructs: Metronome Golems and Chime Elementals pace intervals.
- Key contacts:
  - [Scheduler Threx](../People/scheduler-threx.md) (Topaz dragon), charts throughput windows.
  - [Safety Marshal Prim](../People/safety-marshal-prim.md) (Paradise dragon), greenlights traffic after inspections.

### Magic, Wards, and Infrastructure

- Standing effects/wards: Flux dampers, cadence bells, and hush‑veils to steady crowds.
- Safety systems/failsafes: Soft‑close on gates, drift alarms, and echo‑beacons to regroup.
- Power/portal anchors: Anchors tuned to Nexus timings; redundancy via district beacons.

### Hooks and Encounters

- Plot hook: A surge window opens early; [Conductor Celene](../People/conductor-celene.md) needs quick reroutes.
- Procedural obstacle: A token mismatch strands a shipment—solve for time or proof.
- Social opportunity: Quiet Queue mentoring first‑time travelers.

### Variants

- Peak activity mode: Bell‑paced lines, surge lanes open, Metronome Golems visible.
- Crisis/emergency mode: Soft‑close gates; Quiet Queue converts to assistance bay.
- Planar alignment shift: Cadence bells harmonize; flux feels like a slow tide.

### GM Notes

- Adjudication aids, DCs, complication clocks, consequence ladders.
