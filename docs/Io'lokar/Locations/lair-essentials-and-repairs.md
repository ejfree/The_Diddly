### Mechanics and Rules

- House rules (behavior, breath, magic): No loose breath near resins; hard hats on the floor
- Ordering/service flow (e.g., counter, portal chute, omakase): Assess → quote → fabricate → install → sign‑off
- Hazards/environmental notes: Lift lanes marked; watch for hot cure areas

### Security and Wards

- Protections/alarms: After‑hours bell‑wards; tilt alarms on stock racks
- Wards/anti‑theft: Tool tags that lock to the rack unless checked out
- Portal anchors/safeties: Freight pad with safety cones; keyed to shop foreman

### Hooks and Encounters

- Plot hook: A perch collapse in an old tower needs immediate bracing—[Foreman Cindershod](../People/foreman-cindershod.md) drafts the party for the rush job
- Social scene: Neighborhood safety night on basic anchor checks
- Complication: A batch of bolts arrives magnetized; compasses and wards misbehave during installs
