### Portal Nexus

City‑wide portal hub—anchors, customs, and incident response under one disciplined roof.

### Function and Purpose

- Core mandate/services: Maintain civic anchors, meter cross‑district flows, enforce codes, and handle incidents.
- Audience/users: residents | students | faculty | visitors
- Jurisdiction/scope: City‑wide portals and registered waybeacons; liaises with Aether Artery.

### Location Details

- District/adjacency: Central promenade with clear lines to beacon towers.
- Exterior/architecture: Massive ring hall with bell‑towers and visible anchor pylons.

### Interior and Layout

- Notable areas/rooms: Anchor Hall, Flux Desk, Customs Gates, Incident Yard.
- Capacity/scale: High throughput; overflow rings open on festivals.
- Accessibility (flight, ramps, portals): Ramps, lifts, and glide lanes; staff pads.

### Operations

- Hours/open access: Bell to bell; incident desk 24/7.
- Procedures/queues/permits: Token queues, customs declarations, and inspection flags.
- Dependencies (couriers, portals, guard): Aegis Watch; couriers for parts; city bells for cadence.

### Staff and Roles

- Steward/Head: [Nexus Master Wells](../People/nexus-master-wells.md) (Wellspring dragon), saturated with wild magic, safely channels flux.

  - Flux Monitors (Etheric dragon, 1), reads stress, bleed, and resonance.
  - Customs Gate (Edict dragon, 1), enforces portal codes and bans.

  - [Warder Gant](../People/warder-gant.md) (Bronze dragon), incident response with Aegis Watch.

### Magic, Wards, and Infrastructure
