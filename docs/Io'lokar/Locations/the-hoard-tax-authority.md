### The Hoard Tax Authority

Assesses, records, and collects hoard taxes—clear rules, careful appraisals, and stern but fair relief options.

### Function and Purpose

- Core mandate/services: Appraisals, assessments, payment plans, lien filings, audits, and relief petitions.
- Audience/users: residents | students | faculty | visitors
- Jurisdiction/scope: City‑wide hoard tax code; coordinates with City Hall and Aegis for enforcement.

### Location Details

- Level: L2
- District/adjacency: City Hall ridge; close to Arbitration Spire.
- Exterior/architecture: Tall counters, secure cases, clear signage; bells that never sound rushed.

### Interior and Layout

- Notable areas/rooms: Appraisal Hall, Petition Office, Compliance Desks, and Evidence Vault.
- Capacity/scale: High‑throughput counters; private booths for sensitive matters.
- Accessibility (flight, ramps, portals): Wide ramps, lifts, and a secure portal pad.

### Operations

- Hours/open access: Bell to bell; petition hours posted.
- Procedures/queues/permits: Token queues; documented inventories; hardship forms; receipts sealed at counter.
- Dependencies (couriers, portals, guard): City Hall records; Aegis for seizures; couriers for notices.

### Staff and Roles

- Steward/Head: [Assessor Prime Verdun](../People/assessor-prime-verdun.md) (Green dragon), obsessive accountant of hoards and liens.
