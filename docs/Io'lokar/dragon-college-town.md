# Dragon College Town

The Viridian Salon.
    Considered the finest place for high tea in the continent
    Cocktails & canapés in the evening. Close at 7:30 to make the show.

Right beside is the Tusslers Square. The place for bare knuckle boxing, wrestling, no-limits arena combat. But no actual damage is done, no killing blows. Also training? Gym?

Mimic it off a Theme Park
There should be 4 quadrants again, NSEW.
Maybe it is a flying city above the Ley Lines. Make it like Dalaran

For a dragon university with a diverse and mystical student body, a variety of specialized buildings would enrich the educational and living experience. Here are some ideas for buildings that could be part of your dragon university:

1. **The Draconic Library**: A vast repository of knowledge with enchanted tomes, scrolls, and artifacts. The library would have sections devoted to different fields of study, such as magic, history, and dragon lore.

2. **Elemental Laboratories**: Specialized labs for practical studies and experiments, tailored to different dragon types. For example, a fire-proof lab for fire-breathing dragons, a water-filled aqua lab for sea dragons, and a high-altitude lab for sky dragons.

3. **The Grand Amphitheater**: An open, circular building for lectures, presentations, and gatherings. This amphitheater would be large enough to accommodate dragons of all sizes and equipped with magical amplification for speakers.

4. **The Aerie Dormitories**: Living quarters designed for dragon comfort and privacy. These could include large, open spaces for larger dragons, as well as more secluded nooks for smaller or more introverted species.

5. **The Enchanted Gardens**: Outdoor areas for relaxation and study, with various ecosystems representing different dragon habitats. These could include a lush forest, a rocky crag, and a serene pond.

6. **The Flight Arena**: A spacious, open area for flying practice, aerial sports, and flight-related classes. This could include obstacle courses and areas for aerial combat training.

7. **The Alchemy Tower**: A tall, spiraling tower for the study of potions, magical substances, and transmutation. This would include laboratories, brewing rooms, and a greenhouse for magical plants.

8. **The Arcane Observatory**: A facility for the study of astrology, astral projection, and celestial magic. It would be equipped with telescopes, orreries, and other astral mapping tools.

9. **The Combat Grounds**: An area designated for physical training, martial skills, and controlled combat scenarios. This would be crucial for dragons learning to defend themselves and their territories.

10. **The Artisan Hall**: A place for artistic pursuits like painting, sculpture, and music. This hall would cater to the creative side of dragons, showcasing their art and hosting performances.

11. **The Ancestral Shrine**: A sacred space for dragons to connect with their heritage and ancestors. This could be a place for meditation, ritual ceremonies, and the celebration of dragon culture.

Each of these buildings would play a vital role in the academic and social life of the dragons, providing a well-rounded and immersive educational experience.

The Under Carriage. Aka… The Grundle

Very fancy bar that is essentially open floor and wall allowing for the dragon customers to have views of the ground below as well as

Featherfall. One way permanent wall of force. Encompasses the entirety of the underside of $dalaran.

Create a map of a floating city for dragons. It should be influenced by Dalaran from warcraft. It should have 4 sections, North, South, East & West. It should be a single floating platform where all interior locations are not to scale. It should have levels that go up like Gondor
