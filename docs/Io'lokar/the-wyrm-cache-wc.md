# The Wyrm Cache (WC)

\
Here is a custom design for your dragon-world general store and sacred warehouse, blending elements of commerce, banking, and arcane tradition:

**The Wyrm Cache
Tagline:** *“By Flame, By Fang, By Faith—What Enters Is Bound.”*

**📍 Location:**

* **Main Branch:** Io’lokar, nestled within a sprawling obsidian-and-gold ziggurat near the city’s Nexus Vaults.

* **Outposts:** Strategically placed in every elemental quad at Dragon University, as well as in key settlements, skyports, and even planar anchorage zones.

**🛒 Primary Functions:
1. General Mercantile**

* Offers essential supplies for dragons of all ages: enchanted scrolls, mealstones, scale polish, sleeping crystals, artisanal claw tools, flight balm, etc.

* Rare reagents and academic equipment for university needs (planar anchors, elemental stabilizers, memory-inked quills).

* Locally sourced and plane-traded luxury items from trusted draconic artisans and merchants.

**2. Secure Vaulting & Banking Services**

* Dragons can **deposit** hoard items (gems, magical artifacts, relics) into **hoard-lock vaults**, accessible by scaleprint and psychic signature.

* **Transactional hoards** available for investing, lending, or bartering under neutral supervision.

* Credit scrolls and soul-sealed promissory tokens are issued under the aegis of the Wyrm Cache Oath.

**3. Warehouse & Parcel Hub**

* Used by dragons, merchants, and university departments to **store, ship, or receive** goods—both mundane and magical.

* Temporal stasis crates and anti-theft wards protect all stored items.

* Dimensional lockers can be rented, allowing secure cross-planar storage retrieval.

**🔏 Core Principles:**

* **The Wyrm Cache Compact** is a sacred oath established during the First Draconic Concordance. Breaking it is considered not just a crime—but **an affront to the Draconic Code**.

* All goods **within Wyrm Cache boundaries** are **sacrosanct**, even during war or rivalry. This rule is enforced by ancient guardian constructs and bound spirit-wards.

* The Vaultmaster’s Seal can **ban a dragon from all Wyrm Cache services** if trust is violated, cutting them off from hoard protection and market access.

**🐉 Staff and Key Figures:
Vaultmaster Ormagravex (Steel Dragon, Io’lokar Main)**

* An elder steel dragon who manages all inter-Cache logistics and adjudicates major disputes.

* Known for their unshakable neutrality and obsession with standardized inventory cataloging.

**Scripthatcher Emelith (Pearl Dragon, Dragon University Outpost)**

* Handles academic transactions, student storage, and quad-to-quad parcel exchanges.

* Offers “student hoardlets”—tiny magically sealed lockers sized for growing dragons.

**🧱 Design & Aesthetic:**

* The Io’lokar ziggurat gleams with sigils of all elemental alignments and is constantly surrounded by a low thrum of ambient ward-magic.

* Each outpost echoes this structure in miniature—five-tiered architecture, with draconic runes representing the five spheres: Trade, Trust, Time, Territory, and Tongue.

* Every doorframe is engraved with the sacred phrase:

**“What enters the Cache is Bound by Flame and Oath.”**
Would you like a visual sketch of the Io’lokar ziggurat or the university outpost design? Or perhaps a special event or incident involving a breach attempt?
