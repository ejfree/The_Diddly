# Gambling & Casinos


### The Draconic Gambling Empires of Io'kolar

#### **The Auric Consortium (Gold Dragon Family)**
A bastion of wealth and security, the **Auric Consortium** is the premier name in gambling, finance, and vault services. Their establishments are pristine, operating with a near-religious devotion to fairness, integrity, and the honor of the wager. Their premier vault company, **Auric Vaults & Securities**, is widely regarded as the safest place to store treasure, rare artifacts, and even magical contracts.

- **Motto:** “Fortune Favored, Debt Honored.”

- **Notable Services:**  
  - Traditional gambling: dice games, high-stakes poker, fortune wagers.
  - **Auric Vaults & Securities:** A fortress of wealth safeguarding gold, contracts, and magical assets.
  - Exclusive “Eternal Wager” contracts, where dragons can stake future treasures or even parts of their hoard for high-reward bets.
  - “Golden Bonds”: A banking system where dragons can invest wealth with divine backing from Bahamut, but at the risk of interest in celestial service.

#### **The Argent Syndicate (Silver Dragon Family)**
More unpredictable than their gold dragon rivals, the **Argent Syndicate** thrives on the art of the deal, the excitement of speculation, and the strategy of high-stakes wagers. Their gambling dens are known for games of political intrigue, dragon-race betting, and speculative futures—where bets can influence real-world power struggles. They cater to those who don’t just want to play games but want to manipulate fate itself.

- **Motto:** “Fortune is the Clever Hand That Plays the Game.”

- **Notable Services:**  
  - Betting on trade agreements, diplomatic outcomes, and mercantile wars.
  - **The Argent Boardroom:** A secretive chamber where high-profile deals are sealed through wagers.
  - “Elder Wagers”: Contracts where knowledge, favors, and influence are gambled instead of gold.
  - Exclusive challenges where patrons can risk something as valuable as **a prophecy or fate-bound event**.

#### **The Price of the Wager**
Both institutions operate under an ironclad contract with **Bahamut**, ensuring that all debts are paid, whether in wealth, service, or the soul itself. Any dragon who **signs up to gamble or open an account** agrees that:

1. Upon death, they are bound to **a 1,000-year celestial service** to Bahamut.
2. This service can be paid off early if **their weyr or estate** clears the debt.
3. After 1,000 years, the dragon can **choose** to remain in Bahamut’s realm or depart.

Bahamut’s celestial enforcers, known as the **Ledgerkeepers**, track all draconic debts. These platinum-scaled figures are said to manifest upon death to collect what is owed, ensuring no dragon escapes their agreed-upon fate.

#### **Gambling in Io’kolar**
Both the Auric Consortium and the Argent Syndicate have **multiple establishments** across Io’kolar, ranging from luxurious gambling halls to more exclusive, invite-only locations.

- **On Campus:** The gold dragon **Micky the Stick** manages student affairs and oversees small wagers and financial contracts.

- **The Grand Spire Casino:** The most prestigious gambling hall, run jointly by both families, where the wealthiest dragons come to test their fortune.  

- **The Scales of Fortune:** A mid-tier establishment run by the Argent Syndicate, specializing in strategic betting and future contracts.  

- **The Vaulted Hall:** An exclusive, heavily protected Auric Consortium location, where wagers of immense consequence—such as the future of dragon lineages—are placed.  

### **A Gamble Beyond Gold**
Betting in Io’kolar isn’t just about money. It’s about **legacy, power, and even fate itself.** The dragons who walk into these halls aren’t merely risking their hoards—they are playing with **the weight of eternity.**
