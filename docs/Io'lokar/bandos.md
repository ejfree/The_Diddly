Name: Bandos
Type: Restaurant.

*Location*: First level, city of Ioâ€™lokar

**Specialty:  Peri-Peri Skysquirrel

Description**: The stall is an eclectic mix of wood and metal, reflecting both the ancient traditions of Eberron and the pulsating magic that powers Sharn. A neon sign shaped like a squirrel with flames coming from its mouth flickers above the stall, casting a warm, reddish glow. The tantalizing aroma of roasting squirrel meat mixed with the spicy notes of peri-peri wafts from the stall, drawing in hungry passersby.

**Menu**:
1. *Skysquirrel Peri-Peri Skewers*: Freshly caught squirrel skewered and grilled to perfection, basted in a secret peri-peri sauce that has a hint of dragonfruit and local herbs.
3. *Peri-Peri Skysquirrel Wrap*: Tender squirrel meat, shredded and wrapped in a soft, thin bread made from soarwheat, accompanied by fresh vegetables and a generous drizzling of peri-peri sauce.
5. *Sky Spice Fries*: Thinly sliced tubers, fried until crisp and sprinkled with a unique blend of spices found only in the towers of Sharn. Served with a side of peri-peri mayo.
7. *Elemental Fizz*: A sparkling beverage infused with elemental crystals from the depths of Khyber, providing a refreshing counterpoint to the spicy dishes.

**Owner**: Zil'ora, a petite and spirited gnome with fiery red hair. She often regales customers with tales of how she adapted the recipe from her travels to distant lands and her experiments with various spice combinations.

**Regulars**: From shifters who are fond of the gamey flavor of the squirrel, to warforged who appreciate the fiery kick of the peri-peri sauce on their taste sensors, to adventurers seeking a unique culinary experience, the stall attracts a wide and diverse clientele.

**Specialties**: Every full moon, Zil'ora offers the *Flaming Moon Skysquirrel*: a special dish where the squirrel meat is marinated overnight in a peri-peri sauce mixed with moonberries, giving it an extra kick and a slight magical buzz.
Whether it's for the thrill of trying something new, the tantalizing flavors, or just the joy of dining high above the streets of Sharn with a breathtaking view, Peri-Peri Skysquirrel promises a culinary adventure unlike any other in the City of Towers.
