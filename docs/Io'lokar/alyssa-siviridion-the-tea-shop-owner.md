The “retired” matriarch of the Emerald Dragon Wyer. No longer directs any house activities or participates in elections. Owns a tea shop in IO’klar that is the equivalent of a 3 Michelin star. It is a very quaint shop with a large  selection of garden gnomes each approximately 1 meter tall. They are wear different hats

She runs the main branch of the Sivi’s Libation Emporium, calledThe Viridian Salon. The salon is located in Io’lokar and is one of the best places to eat in the universe. In addition, there are cafes all around the campus. There are even 2 in the commons. Prices for eggies are included as snacks, Drakes and above are required to pay for it out of their meal allowances.

Grandma says you should have a cookie
Chef suggests his [this written in an obvious illusory sign] Troll & Manticore sausage rolls

Her new boyfriend/old fling Kaida owns the Tusseling Gym next door. The building share the kitchen (this is not general knowledge).

The kitchen is run by Chef Jabbie.

Solomon the phoenix/labradoor retriever is ever present whenever he wants to be. Except he can’t be in the dining room during service.

Lyssa is the hostess/greeter. She picks a special teapot for every guest. The entire place is bigger except for one
“SCIF” essentially. However, Lyssa has a method for listening into that room at real time that can not be detected except by DIVINE means.

Lyssa passes the guest off to their tea sommelier, which is a construct, Sammy the Samovar. It build the perfect tea selection for that patron.

Food is served omakase style. There are approximately 15 courses. But these are dragons, so the portion size is pretty big. Lamb with mint sauce would be the whole lamb. The courses are shared by 2 people. Some sort of weird dragon custom. Diners are always segregated into booths or rooms. The noise from a set of guests is never heard by others in the restaurant. There is light jazz playing as background.

Food is delivered to the booths  automatically by their illusionary Sammy the samovar. .

In my dragon university, imaging an ancient emerald dragon who runs a tea shop. She should be the epitome of the dragon grandmother.
