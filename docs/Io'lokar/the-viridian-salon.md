# The Viridian Salon

The Viridian Salon. The salon is located in Io’lokar and is one of the best places to eat in the universe. The kitchen is run by Chef Jabbie. And the salon itself is owned by Alyssa Siviridion.

The lobby is a large hostess stand where Alyssa or her stand-in greets guests and shows them to their tables. And personally chooses their teapot from her collection. The green booths for a circle around a large silver & green crystal cylinder that is actually a samovar, Sammy the samovar. Part of the samovar is a robot looking golem, top half only, that protrudes from the counter. It interacts with guests as the enter & exit.

Solomon the phoenix/labradoor retriever is ever present whenever he wants to be. Except he can’t be in the dining room during service.

Alyssa is the hostess/greeter. She picks a special teapot for every guest. The entire place is bigger except for one
“SCIF” essentially. However, Lyssa has a method for listening into that room at real time that can not be detected except by DIVINE means.

Lyssa passes the guest off to their tea sommelier, which is a construct, Sammy the Samovar. It build the perfect tea selection for that patron.

Food is served omakase style. There are approximately 15 courses. But these are dragons, so the portion size is pretty big. Lamb with mint sauce would be the whole lamb. The courses are shared by 2 people. Some sort of weird dragon custom. Diners are always segregated into booths or rooms. The noise from a set of guests is never heard by others in the restaurant. There is light jazz playing as background.

Food is delivered to the booths  automatically by their illusionary Sammy the samovar. .
