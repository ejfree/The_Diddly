### Daily Life:
Auris begins his day early, pulling his portable claw-shining stand through the bustling streets of Io’lokar. His route takes him past the city’s markets, academic hubs, and gathering places where dragons of all types congregate. He greets everyone with a cheery "Good morning!" regardless of whether they stop for his services or not. His positivity has earned him a reputation as the "Shining Star of Io’lokar." By late morning, Auris sets up his stand in a prime location where affluent dragons and visitors frequently pass by. His afternoons are spent working diligently, polishing claws while chatting with his customers, who range from ancient dragons to young hatchlings. After closing shop, Auris often visits the orphanage to share stories or help younger orphans with their studies.

### Notable Interactions:
1. **Regular Customers:**
   - **Lady Glimmercrown**, a meticulous sapphire dragon, insists on weekly claw-shining sessions. She adores Auris’s work and often gives him valuable advice on presenting himself as a professional.
   - **Draskon Coalflame**, a gruff blacksmith dragon who originally helped Auris build his stand. Though he pretends to be uninterested, he secretly checks on Auris’s progress and occasionally repairs the stand free of charge.

2. **Encounters with Scholars:**
   Auris’s stand is conveniently located near Dragon University’s entrance, where professors and students alike stop by. His eagerness to learn has earned him casual lessons from kind-hearted professors and even passing tips on history, crafting, and magical techniques from students who admire his dedication.

3. **Unexpected Support:**
   One day, a mysterious dragon with iridescent scales resembling starlight stopped at Auris’s stand. After observing Auris work, they left a magical coin—a family heirloom they claimed would bring good fortune. Auris keeps it as a lucky charm.

### Obstacles and Challenges:
1. **Prejudice:**
   Despite his charm, some dragons still look down on him due to his parentage or his humble work. Occasionally, Auris faces dismissive attitudes or outright disdain from more traditional dragons who uphold family pride over individuality.

2. **Competition:**
   A rival claw-shiner, a cunning copper dragon named **Scraptoe**, has set up shop nearby and often undercuts Auris’s prices. Though Auris tries to remain polite, Scraptoe’s underhanded tactics sometimes frustrate him.

3. **Financial Struggles:**
   While Auris manages to save a few coins each week, unexpected expenses (such as stand repairs or material costs) often drain his savings, making his dream of attending Dragon University seem like a distant goal.

---

### Hidden Talents:
1. **Innovative Tinkering:**
   Auris has a knack for improving his equipment. For instance, he recently modified his claw polisher with a spell-infused buffer that applies a protective layer to claws, reducing scratches for up to a month. This innovation has made him popular among customers.

2. **Artistic Flair:**
   Auris is an amateur artist. He paints small designs or engraves runes onto claws upon request, adding a personal touch to his service. These decorations are temporary but have become a unique selling point.

3. **Empathy and Diplomacy:**
   Auris’s ability to connect with others on an emotional level is extraordinary. He often mediates disputes among his customers, using his charm and tact to diffuse tensions.

### Aspirations:
1. **Earning Admission to Dragon University:**
   Auris dreams of majoring in **Diplomacy** or **Crafting**, inspired by his parents’ stories of uniting two rival dragon families. He sees his studies as a way to build bridges between dragons and explore his creative potential.

2. **Building a Legacy:**
   Auris envisions expanding his claw-shining service into a citywide chain. His ultimate goal is to create a guild that offers affordable claw care to dragons of all social standings, ensuring everyone feels valued and seen.

3. **Uncovering Family History:**
   Though he never met his grandparents, Auris holds onto the hope of one day discovering more about his family’s past and possibly mending old wounds between the gold and silver dragon clans.

---

### Unique Abilities:
1. **Electrum Resonance:**
   Auris has a latent magical ability due to his unique heritage. When he’s deeply focused or emotional, his scales emit a gentle, harmonic hum that soothes those around him. This ability is unconscious, but it has earned him a reputation as a calming presence.

2. **Shimmering Glow:**
   His silver-and-gold scales reflect light in a dazzling way, making him stand out in crowds. This natural charisma often works in his favor, drawing customers and allies alike.

---

### Potential Adventure Hooks:
1. **A Lost Treasure Map:**
   One day, Auris discovers a hidden compartment in his stand containing a fragment of a treasure map. The map, it turns out, belonged to his parents and may lead to a relic tied to their forbidden romance.

2. **Family Ties:**
   A mysterious dragon claiming to be his grandparent arrives in Io’lokar. Whether they seek reconciliation or something more sinister is unclear, leaving Auris to navigate this emotional challenge.

3. **City-Wide Threat:**
   When a dark force threatens Io’lokar, Auris’s unique abilities and connections make him an unlikely hero. Whether through diplomacy, crafting, or courage, he must rise to the occasion and protect his city.

Auris’s story is full of heart, ambition, and potential, making him a captivating NPC who can grow with the narrative. Would you like me to focus on any particular aspect of his story or abilities?

Create an npc, an electrum dragon orphan, age 8. He was an orphaned offspring of a Romeo & Juliet type of romance between a  female gold dragon and a male silver dragon. The parents were disowned by the families and went no contact. His parents died when he was young. This unusually silver/gold mottled dragon is a bright chipper young fellow, who is just earning his way in this great city by working as a “claw shiner.” He has a portable stand to polish the claws of dragons through out the city. This is how he is saving money for school.

He lives in the orphanage. He earns money by offering claw polishing for a GP, it is advertised on a sandwich board. He does try to initially negotiate 1gp per claw (as noted on the back of the sandwich board) versus per session. He is very innocent about it.

He is in school. And high likelihood he will be a future student at the Diddly.
