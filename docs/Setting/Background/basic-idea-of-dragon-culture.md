# Basic Idea of Dragon Culture


Argonnessen is a continent to the far southeast of Khorvaire and southwest of Sarlona. It is the home of dragons, the oldest civilization in the world. The continent of Argonnessen is almost totally unexplored by any race of Khorvaire, except for Dragons.

The center of all learning for the continent & the cosmos is the floating city of Knowledge, Io’lokar and the associated university below it, The Diddly.

The total draconic population is approximately 100,000  dragons. Vast majority life in cities or towns, though some types are solitary. Broken up into Weyrs, which belong to a race. Generally population growth is ~0%. If an event caused a dramatic reduction in dragon population, you would see a resultant spike with a return to normal over a century or so (it takes a while to make a dragon)

The Codified Draconic Code provides the rules by which dragon have chosen to adhere to.




Maturation Process
Restricted to Argonessen & their Weyr nursery
1. **Wyrmlings (0-5 years):** These are the youngest dragons. Given a low birth rate,  they might comprise about 5% of the population, or 5,000 dragons. These stay in the Wery nursery, which is a very specialized operation. Lots of edible baby toys. Baby dragons are encouraged to taste.

Begin life as “human”
1. **Young Dragons (6-100 years):** This stage includes dragons that are starting to venture out on their own. They might be about 25% of the population, or 25,000 dragons, reflecting a period of rapid growth and learning.

Sub-Breakdown
6-18 is an option for a human form in Khorvaire as a member of the nobility. They are locked into human form and learn basic training & skills.

19 is called the prep. It is where the humans learn their real dragon roots. This is a year in the wild in Seren. There are human “NPCs” who provide merchant & innkeeper like services for the young dragons. There are “free” versions of this, as well as private guided experiences for the prep year. Small rodent populations along with starter hordes have been stocked by the Draconic Council.

University is 5 years, 20-25. It is considered the best training for any dragon. Always 500 dragons in each class. Other dragons attend the police academy and then join the Eyes of Chronepsis, or they attend the military academy, following on to Light of Siberys. Or they remain in the Vast to build their horde and power.

Eggies - Freshman
Drakes - Sophmore
Year Abroad
Wyverns - Junior
Primus - Senior - Double Size of all others.

1. **Adult Dragons (101-500 years):** Adult dragons, being more powerful and wiser, are likely to survive longer. They might make up 50% of the population, or 50,000 dragons.


1. **Ancient Dragons (500+ years):** The oldest and most powerful dragons. Due to their long lives and the accumulation of enemies or challenges, their numbers would be the smallest, possibly around 20% of the population, or 20,000 dragons.
