# Dragon Maturation Timetable…

* **Wyrmlings (0-5 years):** These are the youngest dragons. Given a low birth rate,  they might comprise about 5% of the population, or 5,000 dragons. These stay in the Wyer nursery, which is a very specialized operation. Lots of edible baby toys. Baby dragons are encouraged to taste.

* **Young Dragons (6-100 years):** This stage includes dragons that are starting to venture out on their own. They might be about 25% of the population, or 25,000 dragons, reflecting a period of rapid growth and learning.
    * Young dragons (6-18) are raised by the Wyer however they choose. Some are locked into other forms and spend those years abroad. There they learn about
    * Age 19 is called “prep year”. It is a special tutorial that takes place on a remote island where you learn your basic dragon instincts. You performance here is a critical part of your acceptance to The Diddly and other academies across the cosmos. This is a year in the wild in Seren. There are “NPCs” who provide merchant & innkeeper like services for the young dragons. There are “free” versions of this, as well as private, guided experiences for the prep year. Small rodent populations along with starter hordes have been stocked by the Draconic Council.
    * The Diddly University is 5 years, 20-25. It is considered the best training for any dragon. There are ONLY 500 dragons in each class.
    * Other dragons attend the police academy and then join the Eyes of Chronepsis, or they attend the military academy, following on to Light of Siberys.
    * Finally those that remain are left to find their way in the Vast to build their horde and power. It is a miserable grind with a high mortality rate.

* **Adult Dragons (101-500 years):** Adult dragons, being more powerful and wiser, are likely to survive longer. They might make up 50% of the population, or 50,000 dragons.

* **Ancient Dragons (500+ years):** The oldest and most powerful dragons. Due to their long lives and the accumulation of enemies or challenges, their numbers would be the smallest, possibly around 20% of the population, or 20,000 dragons.
