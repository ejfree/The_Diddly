# Draconic Council	- better name


1 of each race, determined by the Weyr with the largest horde or another Wery designated version. It is all very contractual. 1 vote.


Argonessen Business is majority
Eberron business is 2/3 vote
Planar business is 2/3 vote
Wars or aggressive actions are 4/5 required vote + agreement of the Wyrmperor. Then there is shared rule like a roman console with the council designate & Wyrmperor acting as co-consuls and each ruling for a year. Each has full veto power.
