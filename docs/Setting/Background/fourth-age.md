# The Fourth Age — Redemption (Reckoning)

Short Name: Fourth Age
Status: Current era (post‑Mourning)

Summary
- Dragons shift from strict Seclusion to guided intervention to prevent civilization‑ending Prophecy divergences. Mortals experience this as covert manipulation and sudden, surgical catastrophes.
- Planar thin places proliferate; Xoriat interference rises (see Eldrich Temple), threatening draconic sanity and coordination.
- A competing Prophecy line (“Extinction Branch”) forecasts Eberron’s unmaking if Redemption fails; first omens present as synchronized cognitive drift within elder broods.

Catalyst
- The Mourning of Cyre: By Council vote (42‑5‑3) the Wymperor authorized a dual‑rift overlay—positive and negative energy—to scrub a catastrophic arc. War Footing remains partially active.

Governing Doctrines
- Stewardship Mandate: Intervene to preserve sapient continuity and Prophecy integrity.
- Silence Doctrine: Obfuscate draconic authorship to avoid reactive divergence.
- War Footing Protocols: Emergency authority to neutralize existential threats with pre‑approved methods.

Prophecy Branches (GM)
- Redemption Line: Dragons stabilize key divergences, shepherding a survivable continuity for mortals and weyrs.
- Extinction Branch: The world‑soul fractures; draconic concord fails; planar noise drowns pattern. Endpoint reads as “Eberron unmade, song without listener.”
- Convergence Indicators: identical misreadings across unrelated oracles; glyphs collapsing into “eight‑spoked nests;” stanza inversions that rhyme only in Xoriat phonemes.

Factions (Draconic)
- Redeemers: Advocate proactive, minimally lethal course corrections and mortal partnerships; popular among younger weyrs.
- Preservationists: Maintain Seclusion, act only through omens and deniable assets; dominant in Lunar, Etheric, Occult weyrs.
- Purifiers: Support culling corrupted lineages and excising “cancerous” technologies; hardline blocs in White and Nightmare.

Known Fronts
- Mournland Arms Race: An unknown actor (likely Lord of Blades) rebuilds pre‑Mourning weapons tuned to exterminate flesh. Redeemers push interdiction; Preservationists prefer containment; Purifiers argue for a cleansing burn of the entire zone.
- Eldrich Temple Breach: Xoriat resonance centers on an imprisoned Mind Core; cults attempt activation. Black‑flight assets went dark; at least one operative (Ulthar) succumbed to madness and turned predatory.
- Council Fracture Drift: Senior strategoi report micro‑schisms, perfect‑logic duels, and ritual duets that resolve to static. Voting blocs harden around inflexible axioms that read “correct” but produce net disharmony.

Insanity Infiltration
- Modality: Low‑amplitude, wide‑band Xoriat resonance bleeds through thin places and nested temples. Presents first as pattern hunger (compulsion to “complete” a broken rhyme), then as moral flattening.
- Early Symptoms: mirror‑thought echoes; synesthetic prophecy parsing; intolerance for stochastic solutions; sleep cycles aligning with eight‑beat metronome.
- Functional Effects: reduced coalition flexibility, increased ritual purity tests, willingness to excise “noisy” sub‑lines (i.e., mortals, dragonkin, or whole weyrs).
- Cultural Cover: Framed internally as “clarity” or “perfect concord,” it passes audits unless counter‑scanned with Siberys‑tuned dissonance rites.

Secrets (GM)
- Lolth’s metaplot: Use Xoriat resonance to drive dragons insane, collapsing Council governance. No temple actor knows this; leave only motif breadcrumbs (spider‑silk threads, eight‑point fracture glyphs).
- Ultimate Bargain: Lolth offers the Pattern (the living weave of the Prophecy) as tithe to the Madness in exchange for a divinely trivial concession—petty, but portfolio‑advancing (e.g., exclusive claim over “Thought‑as‑Web” or restoration of a lost conduit).
- Co‑Sponsor: A Xoriat arch‑intellect promises clean absorption: not conquest, but dissolution into undifferentiated insight—marketed to zealots as “mercy.”
- The Vote Ledger: Rift and Black weyrs led the opposition to the Mourning protocol out of fear that dual‑rift harmonics would thin planar boundaries globally—evidence now emerging at temples.

Doom Clock (GM Tool)
- 1 — Whispers: isolated misreads, private perfectionisms.
- 2 — Choirs: small cells synchronize decisions across continents.
- 3 — Purges: “noisy” lines removed; collateral normalized.
- 4 — Chorus: Council procedures run, but outputs are static.
- 5 — Silence: Redemption Line collapses; Extinction Branch dominates.

How PCs Interact
- Allies or Assets: Work with Redeemer agents who offer tools but keep authorship hidden.
- Opponents: Cross Purifier operations that eliminate “acceptable casualties.”
- Wildcards: Exploit Preservationist bureaucracy to buy time or force transparency.

Knowledge Checks (set by system)
- Common (DC low): The Mourning ended Cyre; dragons are rumored to be involved.
- Uncommon (DC moderate): Council vote counts, existence of War Footing, Redeemer/Purifier split.
- Rare (DC high): Dual‑rift method, Silence Doctrine, early Xoriat motif correlations, rumors of an “Extinction Branch.”
- Esoteric (DC very high): Lolth’s interference hypothesis, ledger of dissenting weyrs by name.

Adventure Hooks
- Shut down a pulse node syncing Mournland rifts toward a lethal resonance event.
- Extract a Redeemer courier trapped in the Eldrich Temple during a Mind Core surge.
- Leak proof of Purifier overreach to force a Council inquiry (political arc).
- Recover a sealed stanza that names the Extinction Branch endpoint and a warding cadence to delay it.
- Conduct a “dissonance liturgy” inside a weyr moot to break synchronization without exposing draconic involvement.
