# Things to think about for your new character



1. You are going to the ONLY real scholastic university. Why did you choose that. Because if you can get into the Diddly, you can probably get into any other choice as well. Why choose this one?
2. What was your home life like. See the dragon maturation timetable below. Think of america in the early 1920s. This are a few bustling cities and a lot of rural country. There is a military & police force. But there still is a fairly small population of dragon kind, total population estimated to be at 100,000 dragons in Argonessen.
3. What did you do from 6-18? Did your family send you to cool places or now?
4. What was your experience like on the tutorial island?
5. Same with technology from that era. While there are no planes because why would a flying creature do thatâ€¦ There certainly is electricity, telephone communications with centralized video pay phones. Also have speaking stones which essentially allow anyone to send short messages, 242 characters.
6. Dragons do tend to gather into units called Weyrs. There are generally color based, but not always. Think of a corporation. The land they control & own is part of the Weyr Estate. Individuals can own part of the specific estate, but that is between the individual Weyr.
7. You are 20 years old. This is the only hard rule. See the lore section with how I built the maturation process.
8. I am open to whatever you want to do as a college-age dragon.
9. Yes, you can have a bonus archetype. And as things go we may toss in a few more free ones because rule of cool
10. Yes, I play with the rule of cool.


Finally, I sometimes get a rule or other stuff wrong. Just tell me. I will sort it out.
