# The Pale Choir (Xoriat’s Dragon-Only Insanity Plague)

A slow-acting, biological affliction engineered out of Xoriat’s alien ecology. It behaves like a living prion-fungus hybrid that only completes its life cycle inside draconic physiology. Other creatures can carry spores without symptoms, but only dragons suffer progression.

— Also known as: Wyrmblight, the Fractured Song, Crown of Splinters

## Core Facts
- Vector: Aberrant micro-spores (“pale mycelia”) and a misfolded peptide called the foldsong. Both are biological; neither is inherently magical. They synchronize with the draconic “world‑song” centers in the brain.
- Host specificity: Dragons only. Non-dragons can carry surface spores on hoards, scales, or gear but cannot incubate or amplify the pathogen.
- Tempo: Very slow. Incubation measured in weeks; progression in months to years (older dragons may stretch to decades/centuries without intervention).
- Purpose: Xoriat seeded it to disorient, isolate, and weaponize dragons against each other without creating obvious outbreaks.

## Origin and Mechanism
- Aberrant biology from Xoriat produced a myco-prion that exudes a peptide (the foldsong) which binds to a draconic‑unique neuroprotein used for breath control, hoard valuation, and communal resonance (the “song centers”).
- Colonization begins in the sinuses and scale-oils near the jaw hinge, migrates via olfactory nerves to the brain. The foldsong subtly retunes the dragon’s internal hum, fracturing perception and impulse control.
- Because this is biological, antimagic and curse-breaking do little. Heat, solvents, and targeted peptides work; psionic or harmonic therapy can disrupt the pathological resonance.

## Transmission
- Hoard contamination: Spores cling to metals, gems, bone, and dragon‑oil residues. Mixing hoards, gifting coins, or trading ancient relics spreads the pathogen.
- Breath adjacency: Extended proximity to a diseased dragon’s resting exhalations (sleep dens, lecture halls, ritual vaults) carries aerosols to susceptible dragons.
- Eggs and scale-shed: Nonviable in eggs. Scales can surface-carry spores for months but do not infect non-dragons.

## Stages and Signs
Progress checks occur on a long cadence. Mechanics below are system-neutral first, with a 5e-style option.

1) Whispering Scale (Incubation 2–8 weeks; Stage length 1–6 months)
- Subtle behaviors: obsessive recounting/reordering of hoards; misophonia to other dragons’ breaths; synesthesia with coin-clatter.
- Physiological: micro-tremor of head crests; irregular nictitating membrane blinks; faint chalky scale patina along jawline.
- Social: overprotective of lair thresholds; new suspicion of clutchmates or flightmates.

2) Fractured Song (Stage length 6–24 months)
- Cognitive: auditory hallucinations of off-key draconic chorus; intrusive ideation about “corrupted” hoard pieces; dissociation in flight.
- Breath anomalies: off-cycle pulses, sputter between types for gem/metallic dragons, or delayed initiation.
- Aggression shift: targets fellow dragons first; hoard-maiming behaviors (melting, shattering, or burying treasures to “quiet” them).

3) Crown of Splinters (Stage length years; without treatment becomes chronic)
- Psychosis: paranoid territorial rages; compulsive isolation; self-sabotage of lair wards.
- Resonant harm: roars that inflict psychic overtones on nearby dragons; echo-lairs carry maddening harmonics for days.
- Wasting: reduced grooming, scale delamination at jaw and chest; breath weapon misfires under stress.

## PF2e Affliction (Disease)
- Name: The Pale Choir
- Level: 10 (adjustable; see GM Dials)
- Traits: disease, uncommon, auditory, mental, dragon
- Susceptible: Only creatures with the dragon trait. Others can be asymptomatic carriers on surfaces but never contract the disease.
- Onset: 2–8 weeks
- Saving Throw: Fortitude DC 28
- Stage Duration: 1 week
- Maximum Duration: Indefinite
- Progression: At the end of each stage’s duration, the creature attempts a Fortitude save to determine progression (critical success reduce 2 stages; success reduce 1; failure increase 1; critical failure increase 2). A creature that reaches stage 0 recovers but remains a surface carrier for 1 additional week unless decontaminated.
- Cure: Three consecutive successful saves.

Stages
- Stage 1 (Whispering Scale): stupefied 1; the dragon takes a –1 status penalty to Perception checks and Will saves against effects originating from dragons; if the dragon has a Breath Weapon, increase its cooldown by 1 (for example, 1d4+1 rounds).
- Stage 2 (Fractured Song): stupefied 2 and clumsy 1; the dragon takes a –2 status penalty to Diplomacy and Performance checks made to interact with dragons; if the dragon has a Breath Weapon, it can’t reduce the cooldown below 2 rounds (minimum), and once per encounter the GM can require a DC 5 flat check when the dragon uses its Breath Weapon; on a failure, the action is lost.
- Stage 3 (Crown of Splinters): stupefied 3; whenever the dragon rolls initiative within 60 feet of another dragon or a significant hoard (GM’s discretion), it becomes confused for 1 round (this is a mental effect). If the dragon has a Breath Weapon, increase its cooldown by 2 instead (for example, 1d4+2 rounds).

Counteracting and Treatment (PF2e)
- Treat Disease: Standard rules. Medicine DC equals the disease DC. Success grants a +2 circumstance bonus to the patient’s next save; critical success grants +4.
- Remove Disease: You can attempt to counteract the Pale Choir, but treat the disease as 2 levels higher for counteract level comparisons. On a successful counteract, reduce the stage by 1 (2 on a critical success). Magical effects that remove curses have no effect.
- Harmonic Therapy (10 minutes, three dragons of distinct lineages; Performance or Occultism DC 28): On success, the patient immediately attempts a Fortitude save against the disease with a +2 circumstance bonus; on critical success, increase the bonus to +4. Failure imposes no penalty; critical failure sickens the patient 1 for 1 hour.
- Hibernation Protocol (Downtime): One lunar cycle (28 days) of torpor within a psionically quiet vault halts progression (no saves during this time). Two consecutive cycles automatically reduce the disease by 1 stage.
- Surgical Ablation (Downtime, risky): Medicine DC 30 with appropriate tools and support. On success, reduce the disease by 1 stage and remove any Breath Weapon cooldown increases for 1 month; on critical success, reduce by 2 stages. On failure, no change and the dragon is clumsy 1 for 1 week; on critical failure, the dragon takes a permanent –1 status penalty to the DC of its Breath Weapon and the disease doesn’t improve.

Decontamination (PF2e)
- Scale/Oil Bath: 1 hour, Medicine or Crafting DC 24. On success, remove surface spores from a dragon; on critical success, the next Fortitude save vs. the disease gains a +1 circumstance bonus. On failure, no effect.
- Hoard Purge: 8 hours per 100 Bulk of valuables, Crafting DC 26 with appropriate heat and acid supplies; success removes spores from affected items. On critical failure, 10% of unattended mundane items suffer cosmetic damage (no mechanical effect) from over-etching.

Foldbreak Draught (Alchemical Item)
- Level 9; Price 120 gp; Bulk L; Traits alchemical, consumable, elixir, uncommon
- Activate: Drink (Interact)
- Effect: For 24 hours, you gain a +2 item bonus to saves against the Pale Choir. The first time you succeed at a save against the disease during this duration, reduce the stage by an additional 1. If you have a Breath Weapon, ignore any cooldown increase from the disease during this duration.


## Treatments and Containment
- Decontamination: Copper-salt and pine-resin oil baths for scales, then dry heat (forge or geothermal vents). Hoards baked in dry heat and washed with weak acid baths remove spores without damaging most treasures. See PF2e section below for task DCs.
- Harmonic therapy: Three healthy dragons of different lineages perform a 10‑minute resonant chant within a warded chamber (silence wards outside, amplification inside). In play, this grants a bonus toward resisting or regressing the disease.
- Peptide inhibitors: “Foldbreak” draught brewed from voidcap mycelium and kraken ink; taken daily during treatment it bolsters resistance and stabilizes breath control.
- Hibernation protocol: A full lunar cycle of torpor within psionically quiet stone (lead-lined or voidglass vaults) halts progression; prolonged cycles can regress severity.
- Last resort: Surgical ablation of jaw-hinge mycelia combined with Foldbreak. Risky, but it halts the most dangerous resonance cascades when successful. See PF2e section for mechanics.

## Prevention
- Never mix hoards without heat/acid decon. Quarantine gifted relics for 30 days.
- Ventilation stones in dormitories and lecture caves; capture and incinerate dust.
- Scale-oil hygiene after joint flights and tournaments; personal breath-masks (voidglass beak-guards) in communal spaces during outbreaks.

## Diagnostics
- Field signs: chalky jaw patina; fractal rosette pattern in the pupil under low light; hoard reordering compulsion.
- Lair assay: place a silver coin on a heated plate; if it exudes chalky filament ash, the lair is contaminated.
- Song test: have the subject hum the First Interval; micro-lag and pitch drift indicate Stage 2+.

## Lore Hooks and Play Seeds
- The Silent Vault: A university hoard-vault went quiet; its resonance stones now emit a dead tone. Enter, decon the hoard, and recover compromised research.
- Gift of the Pale King: A ceremonial coin from an ancient drakeflight spreads the pathogen through commencement garlands.
- Choir in the Walls: An elder quarantines herself as her roars begin to splinter minds; can the party prepare a warded chamber and perform the chant before she turns on the city?
- Carrier’s Bargain: Pseudodragons smuggle spores unknowingly; bargaining with them reveals a Xoriat-bent patron funding a black-market of “purified” relics.

## GM Dials
- Pace: Stage duration defaults to 1 week. For high tension, reduce to 1 day; for epics, keep 1 week or extend to 1 month.
- DC by Tier (moderate baselines): Level 5 DC 22; Level 10 DC 28; Level 15 DC 34. Increase by 2 for an especially virulent strain or poor containment; decrease by 2 for early detection and excellent hygiene.
- Specificity: Allow metallic/chromatic/gem variants (e.g., gem dragons manifest stronger psychic overtones but slower breath misfires).
- Crossovers: Because it’s biological, smart NPCs can research countermeasures; reward preparation, quarantine, and good hygiene.

## Why It Only Affects Dragons
The foldsong binds a neuroprotein unique to dragons—developed for breath regulation, hoard valuation, and resonant communication. Non-dragons lack the binding site: they can carry spores on surfaces, but the myco-prion cannot replicate or retune their minds.
