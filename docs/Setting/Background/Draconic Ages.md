# Draconic Ages



1st Age - The Creation
	use Eberron founding theory.
According to myth, the three <u>[Progenitor Wyrms](https://eberron.fandom.com/wiki/Progenitor_Dragons)</u> created reality itself, weaving the thirteen planes into existence, each a concept founding the material plane. The three were alleged to create (or discover) the Draconic Prophecy. Though, eventually Khyber sought to claim dominion over the reality that she and her siblings had created and a battle ensued. She struck Siberys unprovoked, tearing the dragon apart. Eberron, knowing she could not defeat Khyber in battle, wrapper her coils around Khyber, becoming a living prison that would forever contain the wyrm's evil.
In the aftermath, Sibery's shattered body became the golden ring of <u>[dragonshards](https://eberron.fandom.com/wiki/Dragonshard)</u> that wrap around the planet; Eberron became the world, the source of all natural life; and Khyber became the Underdark, the source of many evils to come

2nd Age - The Overcoming -
	Closing off gf Khyber and leads up to the Dragon Giant war. Realizing the mistake of meddling in lesser races, they seclude themselves on Argonessen.

3rd Age - The Reclusion
	is this the current era? Or did we just have a change in eras. This does NOT mean no interaction. Dragons purposefully caused the mournland.

Result of draconic intervention into human affairs. Cyre scientists discovered a “magic atom bomb” This had been closely tracked by the Draconic Council. When it was determined that action was required, the DC decided to proactively cleanse the area to prevent a very problematic arc in the Draconic Prophecy. The council voted 42 in favor, 5 against, and 3 abstentions from the weyrs. Since this passed the 80% threshold for “war footing” the Wymperor at the time agreed.

5 against
Apocalypse
Rift
White
Nightmare
Black


3 abstentions
Etheric
Lunar
Occult

The mourning was really the opening of a positive energy rift and negative energy rift into Cyre. Each pulses every other round dealing 2d6 of that damage type. However, there  is a potion available that allows you to exist in the environment for 24 hours.


Professor Tombkeeper has a strong theory that draconic intervention means we are in a new age. Based on the threat, he calls this new age….

4th Age - The Redemption? This is now? Or are we still in the seclusion.
	Dragons taking positive steps to save the world from the idiots that inhabit in. In some view that does include removal of some/all existing sentient species and repopulating.

This IS actually happening in the mournland. Someone (LoB) is rebuilding the nuclear infrastructure to kill flesh types.
