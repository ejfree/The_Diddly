# Background

I started this project in late 2023 based on the release of Battlezoo Dragons. This provided 50+ new dragon races and a whole system to level as a dragon, including new feats for all levels. I then decided to mimic Stixhaven as well as the Fantasy High Junior year downtime rules and approach to encounters. From all that I decided that the next campaign was going to be a 1-20 at this dragon university. Here is where I got the maps from [https://www.patreon.com/cassastereo](https://www.patreon.com/cassastereo)

The setting is the continent of Argonessen, on the continent of eberron where 4 ley lines meet. This university, Depository of Interplanar Draconic Disciplines, Lore, Yield Surging, QUintessence , and Arcano-elemental and Techno Mechanics is near the center of the continent. Above it is Io’Kalar the city of knowledge. This is also a city that non-dragons inhabit, at least on the first level, where they are restricted to. No non-dragon flight is allowed. Nor is travel through the earth/stone.

Now then I got into the name. I knew it needed to have a nickname. As I was creating the majors and the individual “schools”, I was able to see that “DIDDLYSQUAT” could potentially work, with a short name that was obvious. The Diddly. With the center arena called… The Grand Ol’Diddly.

This grand edifice is a multifunctional magical arena that is also multidimensionally large and can have ANY size show from outside to underground or planar. It also houses the “Freshman aka Eggie” dorms. The freshman live on 5 floors in rooms that surround the arena. [https://housing.arizona.edu/dorms/navajo-pinal-stadium](https://housing.arizona.edu/dorms/navajo-pinal-stadium). Each room is a 20x20 space that the occupant can mold to their desires including environmentals.

Four magical leylines also interact under the center of the arena. The leyline convergence on August 1st signifies the traditional start of the Fall Semester at the Diddly. These leylines also separate the campus into 4 distinct quadrants based on the elements.

From there I created the majors below and started working on the details on the campus map.

<u>**Major Areas**</u>
Lore

* **Prophecy**: A major dedicated to studying the draconic prophecy. Hardest major at the university.

* **Dragon History**: A major dedicated to studying the long and rich history of dragonkind, their impact on the world of Eberron, and the ancient prophecies associated with them.

* **Ancient Relics and Artifacts**: This major would focus on the discovery, study, and preservation of ancient artifacts from the Age of Dragons and earlier civilizations in Eberron.

Yield Surging

* **Economic Dominance and Resource Management**: Teaching dragons how to manage and accumulate wealth, control resources, and exert economic influence.

* **Mineral Extraction & Refinement:** Teaches techniques for maximizing resource extraction along with all refinement of those materials into resources available for crafting. This is usually a hands on major.

* **Arcane Artifice and Enchantment Studies**: Teaches the creation of magic items

Quintessence

* **Planar Studies**: Dragons in Eberron might study the various planes of existence, their interactions with the material plane, and the beings that inhabit them.

* **Political Intrigue and Diplomacy**: A major focusing on the complex political landscape of Eberron, teaching dragons how to navigate and influence the various nations and factions.

* **Magical Theory and Application**: An advanced study of magic, its principles, and practical applications. This would cover a broad range of magical disciplines and their uses in the world.

Archano-elemental and Techno Mechanics

* **Eldritch Engineering**: Combining the principles of engineering with eldritch magic, this major would involve creating magical structures, devices, and possibly even new forms of magic-infused machinery.

* **Arcanomechanics**: The study of combining magic with mechanical and technological advancements. This field would delve into creating magical constructs, improving airship designs, and developing new magical technologies.

* **Elemental Binding**: A specialized field focusing on the binding and harnessing of elemental creatures and forces for various purposes, such as powering airships or creating elemental weapons.
