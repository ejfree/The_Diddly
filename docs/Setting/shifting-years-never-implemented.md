# Shifting years (never implemented)

So I am thinking and would like your thoughts. Current "plan" is a 5 year program where the 3rd year is an away year. Each year was thought of as fairly rigid constructs of 12 months. So it was intended to mimic a traditional uni schedule. This might be ok as at upper levels as everything will eventually become “independent study.” There is a 2-1 ratio teachers to students for all majors. Dragons do a lot of independent research and many are on sabbatical at any time as well

But is that the best for the story? That is what I would like your opinions on.

Current Thought
Eggie 1-4
Drake 5-8
Gap 9-12
Wyverns 13-16
Primus 17-20

Versus…

 I am starting to think that instead of the rigid year structures after year 1, eggie year of course, but then after the summer capstone project

Eggie 1-6 (allows for more exploration of the entry level classes without slogging through a few early levels to get the same impact. Expect to have level 4 at XMAS break, with 5 at spring break, and 6 at end of eggie year.)

2nd year 7-12
Still called drake. But focus here is on the curriculum from your teacher/major. There may be a special class that semester or a research project. In addition focus will be on finding a “summer adventure” or whatever is draconic for “Rumspringa of death”. Aeternus Crucible?

STW 13-17
Larger “adventure” where the flight has to prove their ability to be a dragon. This is always a large project/exploration/relic recovery.

18-20 Flight Capstone Project. Some grand battle? What part do 5 not-ancient dragons do in this eventuality. How can they actually matter?
