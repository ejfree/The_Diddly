# Prophecy



Here is a draconic prophecy in the style of the *Draconic Prophecy* from Eberron. It uses metaphor, celestial alignments, and layered meanings ‚Äî avoiding naming Lloth or Tiamat directly, while alluding to both ‚Äî and references the events of the classic GDQ (G1‚Äì3, D1‚Äì3, Q1) series as fate-bound steps in a greater cosmic struggle:

**üìú** ***Fragment of the Black Coil, etched in obsidian beneath the Vault of Sighs***

*‚ÄúWhen the third sun weeps shadows across the firmament,
And the Threads of Night are drawn taut across the World-Weave,
Then shall She-Who-Spins-Truths seek the Five-Locked Chain.‚Äù*

*The Bonded Queen stirs in the cradle of all greed,
Her breath lies buried beneath five golden seals,
But when blood of her blood breaks the giants‚Äô spine,
The seals shall cry with fractured tongues.*

*First fall the Children of Stone,
Who feast upon valleys and gorge on root and hill.
Then the Sons of Ice shall melt before dragonfire and defiance,
And the Pyre-Lords shall be cast into their own crucibles.*

*Only through Young Wings shall these towers fall‚Äî
For the old claws are chained to the pact.*

*Beneath the crust, where forgotten scales sleep,
The foul ones stir: flesh that reeks, minds that warp, eyes that burn.
The scaleless children of darkness rise in waves:
First the stink of the Deep Hunger,
Then the mad prayers of the Drowned Eyes,
Then the blade-kiss of the Black Matrons.*

*Three steps down the Spiral of Despair,
And three keys turned in the Gate of Silken Chains.*

*Should the Weaver ascend the Web of Worlds,
The Pale Queen shall wake.
Her wings will shadow suns, her voice will unmake stars.
The Balance will fall,
And the Flame, the Fang, and the Formless will war in final reckoning.‚Äù*

*Yet hope clings to the wyrmlings bold‚Äî
For prophecy favors not the ancient,
But those who choose the path unwalked.*

**Interpretive Notes:**

* **"She-Who-Spins-Truths"**: Lloth, never named but clearly described through her manipulative, web-weaving nature.

* **"Five-Locked Chain" and "Bonded Queen"**: Tiamat, bound behind five seals‚Äîone for each chromatic dragon head.

* **"Blood of her blood"**: Dragons (or those chosen by dragons) accidentally furthering the plot by defeating giant-kind, triggering a domino effect.

* **"Children of Stone", "Sons of Ice", "Pyre-Lords"**: G1, G2, G3 ‚Äì Hill, Frost, and Fire Giants.

* **"Deep Hunger", "Drowned Eyes", "Black Matrons"**: D1, D2, D3 ‚Äì Troglodytes, Kuo-Toa, and Drow.

* **"Spiral of Despair" and "Silken Chains"**: The descent into the Underdark and eventual confrontation with the Spider Queen in Q1.

* **"Flame, Fang, and Formless"**: Possible draconic or cosmological forces‚Äîperhaps The Flame (Eberron‚Äôs Silver Flame), The Fang (draconic prophecy/Argonnessen), and The Formless (the Daelkyr or chaos beyond).
Let me know if you want this carved into a particular artifact, recorded in a dragon's dream, or recited as part of a ritual or bardic canticle.

Certainly. Here's a more general, cryptic draconic prophecy ‚Äî a **breadcrumb-style fragment** meant to spark an investigation. It's vague enough to require interpretation, but poignant enough to suggest urgency and danger. This version might be found as a mural, on a half-burned scroll, or whispered by a prophetic entity like a sphinx or ancient dragon.

**üìú** ***The Whispered Scale ‚Äì Fragment of a Lesser Prophecy***

*‚ÄúWhen the web is spun across the sky
And the five flames begin to flicker,
Beware the song sung deep below‚Äî
For it seeks to shake the chains of the Queen Below the World.‚Äù*

*The old enemies shall rise again:
First the Gluttons of Stone,
Then the Frozen Brood,
Then the Lords of Ash.*

*Beneath them waits the Threefold Shadow‚Äî
Hunger, Madness, and Blade.*

*Follow the trail of broken crowns,
For where giants fall,
The weaver‚Äôs fangs grow bolder.‚Äù*

**Suggested Use in Adventure:**
This could be found:

* Etched in **Draconic runes** beneath a ruined temple.

* As a **scribbled note** by a mad scholar studying planar disturbances.

* Delivered as a **warning** from a dream or a dragonmark vision.

**Breadcrumb Hooks:**

* **"Five flames flicker"** could relate to planar instability or draconic seal weakening.

* **"Broken crowns"** might refer to giant leaders slain in specific regions (G1-G3).

* **"Threefold Shadow"** hints at the sequence of enemies (trogs, kuo-toa, drow).

* **"Queen Below the World"** is deliberately vague but ominous ‚Äî suggesting something ancient and buried.
Let me know if you'd like versions that fit into different in-game languages, locations, or dragon factions (e.g., Chamber, Talons of Tiamat, etc.).
