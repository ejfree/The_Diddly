# How to do Q….

Lloth is attempting to subvert Eberron….via the drow and the giants. This is a 250 year plan, and they are currently in year 217. The plan starts with Lloth and extends into a drow civilization located beneath Sharn. Her ultimate plan is to drop the undercity Sharn deep into immense caverns underneath them, using some sort of fusion bomb devices. This will cause the Air Manifest Zone to shift, dropping the city into the resulting hole in the ground.

Currently, they have an exploratory hole to the surface, located in Areneal. It was guarded by Ogres, but now by a dragon, who is a professor at the university Professor Nyxar Veilcore, Umbral Dragon.
