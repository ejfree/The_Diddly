# The Shardscale Choir — Drow Kobold War-Legion (PF2e)

An army-sized formation of over a thousand kobolds conditioned by drow alchemists and mind-choir handlers. They were the first living test-bed for Xoriat’s “Pale Choir” principles. The drow use primers to make kobolds susceptible to a war-strain derived from the dragon-only disease, trading longevity and sanity for short-term battlefield ferocity and cohesion.

— Also called: Choirlings, The Coin-Swarm, Shardscales

## Force Overview
- Size: 1,200–1,600 kobolds on rotation; 1,000 deployable at any time.
- Parent House: Most commonly attached to House Dravun (beasts/thralls) with alchemical support from House Veythrae.
- Purpose: Shock-infantry that overwhelms through numbers, noise, and coordinated trap-ambush doctrine amplified by choir resonance.
- Readiness: 60% primed (serum active), 20% in recovery, 20% training/logistics.

## Organization
- 10 Choir Cohorts (100–120 kobolds each)
  - 5 Warbands per cohort (20–24 kobolds each)
    - 1 Choir Captain (elite kobold commando) and 1 Drow Handler per warband
    - Mix: skirmishers with spears/sling, 2–4 sappers, 1–2 shamans/orators
- Support Cadres: 40 alchemists, 20 trapwrights, 12 resonant drummers, 6 surgeons
- Handler Corps: 60 drow overseers (whips, signal-venoms, silence wards)

## Doctrine & Tactics
- Concentric Swarm: Warbands encircle, throw caltrops/ball bearings, then surge on drum cue.
- Hoardstroke: They target valuables to trigger “Choir Frenzy” boons (see variant rules) and demoralize foes.
- Trap Bloom: Sappers pop pre-laid snare lines and spike pits as the choir drives targets.
- Dragon-Bane Drills: Choirlings are trained to engage dragon‑sized foes, piling onto wings, joints, and breath vents.

## PF2e Variant Rules: Pale Choir War-Strain (Kobold)
The original Pale Choir targets dragons only. Drow engineered a battlefield variant that works on kobolds using a primer serum. Without the primer, kobolds can carry spores but don’t contract the disease.

Affliction — Pale Choir, Kobold War-Strain
- Level: 5; Traits: disease, uncommon, auditory, mental, kobold
- Susceptible: Creatures with the kobold trait that have consumed a Choir Primer Serum within the last 7 days.
- Onset: 1 day; Saving Throw: Fortitude DC 22; Stage Duration: 1 day; Cure: 3 consecutive successes.
- Progression: Standard affliction progression. At stage 0, the kobold recovers but suffers stupefied 1 for 24 hours.

Stages
- Stage 1: stupefied 1; Choir Frenzy (see below) triggers on first round of any encounter containing a hoard/valuables or a dragon.
- Stage 2: stupefied 2; Choir Frenzy triggers at the start of each encounter and the kobold takes a –1 status penalty to AC while frenzied.
- Stage 3: stupefied 3; when rolling initiative within 60 feet of a dragon or significant hoard, the kobold becomes confused for 1 round (mental), then enters Choir Frenzy; after the encounter, the kobold is fatigued.

Choir Frenzy (Kobold War-Strain)
- Duration: 3 rounds; Traits: emotion, mental
- Effects: The kobold gains a +2 status bonus to damage with simple weapons and unarmed attacks, takes a –1 status penalty to AC, and can’t use actions with the concentrate trait except to Stride toward or Strike a designated foe. At the end of each of its turns, if it didn’t Strike that round, it takes 1 mental damage.
- Ending: The kobold can end the frenzy early with a DC 5 flat check at the end of its turn; on a failure, the frenzy persists.

Countermeasures (PF2e)
- Treat Disease: Medicine DC 22; success grants +2 circumstance to next save (as normal).
- Remove Disease: Counteract as a 7th-level disease (treat as +2 levels for counteract only). Success reduces stage by 1; critical success by 2.
- Silence Fields: Areas under silence negate the auditory trait of the disease, granting a +1 status bonus to saves for creatures within.
- Anti-Choir Tuning Forks (item, uncommon): Held or worn; once per day, activate to gain a +2 item bonus to Will saves vs. confusion and to checks to end Choir Frenzy for 10 minutes.

## Alchemical Support
Choir Primer Serum (Alchemical Item)
- Level 5; Price 30 gp; Traits alchemical, consumable, elixir, uncommon
- Activate Drink (Interact)
- Effect For 7 days, a kobold becomes susceptible to the Pale Choir War-Strain and gains a +5-foot status bonus to Speed. During this time, when the kobold would gain temporary Hit Points, it gains +2 additional temporary HP. Each time Choir Frenzy begins, the drinker must attempt a DC 5 flat check; on a failure, it becomes sickened 1 after the frenzy ends.

Resonance Drum (Battlefield Gear)
- Level 6; Price 55 gp; Bulk 2; Traits auditory, uncommon
- Activate 2 actions (Interact, Manipulate)
- Effect Beat a pattern that triggers Choir Frenzy in allied kobolds who are already affected by the war-strain and within 60 feet. Enemies within 30 feet must succeed at a DC 22 Will save or be frightened 1 (auditory, emotion, mental). A creature is temporarily immune for 1 hour.

## Example Units (PF2e)
- Choir Warband (Level 5 encounter, 80 XP): 6 Kobold Choir Skirmishers, 2 Sappers, 1 Choir Captain, 1 Drow Handler.
- Choir Pike-Box (Level 7 severe encounter, 120 XP): 10 Skirmishers, 4 Sappers, 2 Shielders, 1 Shaman/Orator, 1 Drow Handler with Resonance Drum.
- Dragon-Bane Clutch (Level 9 extreme vs. single target): 12 Skirmishers, 4 Climbers with pitons and hook-ropes, 2 Sappers; all begin adjacent due to tunneling approach.

Apply the following simple templates to base kobold stat blocks from your bestiary to create the “Choir” variants:
- Choir Skirmisher: +2 damage (status) while frenzied; –1 AC while frenzied; gains the Choir Frenzy ability.
- Choir Sapper: As skirmisher, plus 2 alchemical bombs (level-appropriate) and a 10-foot snare line (Thievery DC 20 to spot/disable).
- Choir Shaman/Orator: Gains occult spell DC equal to its level-appropriate DC; can cast fear once per hour; can attempt to end an ally’s confusion with a DC 22 Performance check (counteract rank 3).
- Choir Captain: Elite adjustment; aura 10 feet granting allied kobolds a +1 status bonus to attack rolls against creatures currently affected by fear.

## Logistics and Sustainability
- Attrition: 10–20% monthly without heavy rotation; long-term stupefaction and fatigue require clinics.
- Clinics: Lead-lined sleep vaults, hot mineral baths, and “Foldbreak” draughts reduce regression time.
- Replacements: Every cohort trains 30 fresh recruits per month to maintain the 1,000‑ready threshold.

## Hooks
- Break the Drums: Steal or destroy the resonance drums before the drow launch a surface raid.
- Rescue the Choir: A sympathetic handler wants out and can provide primer formulas in exchange for extraction.
- Dragon Bait: The drow plan to lure a young dragon into a cavern kill-box to “tune” an entire cohort mid-battle.
