##
Great — let’s build **House Veythrae**, the **arcane-dominant rival to Xilrath**, as a full **PF2e-style organization**.

## **House Veythrae (PF2e Organization)**

**Theme**
The arcane house of the city, obsessed with magical supremacy, shadowfire research, and demonic pacts. Their halls are half-wizard academy, half-laboratory. They disdain brute force, but their battle-mages, rituals, and bound fiends give them terrifying battlefield impact.

**Hierarchy (by Tier)
Matron Mother (Lvl 15–17 Boss)**

* **Role:** Archmage & High Priestess hybrid; rules by intellect and magical might.

* **Statblock Base:** Drow Priestess of Lolth (Bestiary 2) modified with Wizard (Evocation/Shadow) chassis; Level 16–17.

* **Abilities:** 9th-level spells (arcane + divine overlap); shadowfire magic (flame + darkness hybrid effects); Demonic Binding (summon fiend 8th–9th).

* **Quirk:** Believes Lolth favors her arcane superiority over Xilrath’s “soldier queens.”

**Arcane Council (Lvl 11–13)**

* **Role:** Circle of mage-commanders who oversee war spellcraft, laboratories, and demon pits.

* **Statblock Base:** Drow Mage (Bestiary 2) reskinned as Specialist Wizards (Conjuration, Necromancy, Evocation).

* **Abilities:** Battle magic (fireball, shadow evocation), summoning circles, warding rituals.

* **Numbers:** 4–6, each focused on a magical school or battlefield role.

**Battle-Wizards (“Shadowfire Cadres”) (Lvl 7–10)**

* **Role:** Squads of 10–20 wizards, each led by a council member.

* **Statblock Base:** Drow Wizard (Lvl 7–9) with specialist archetypes (Counterspell, Summoner, Fire Mage).

* **Abilities:** Area control (darkness, web, fireball), buff/debuffs, arcane bombardment.

* **Numbers:** ~200 across the house.

**Shadowguard (Lvl 5–7)**

* **Role:** Arcane-enhanced soldiers, blending martial discipline with magic wards.

* **Statblock Base:** Drow Fighter or Rogue (Lvl 5) with Wizard archetype.

* **Abilities:** Fight under magical wards, use scrolls, protect mages.

* **Numbers:** ~300

**Apprentices & Adepts (Lvl 1–4)**

* **Role:** Student mages and priest-acolytes, fodder for experiments or expendable battlefield use.

* **Statblock Base:** Drow Wizard Apprentice (Lvl 1–2), Acolyte (Lvl 1).

* **Abilities:** Minor hexes, alchemy, cantrips, scroll use.

* **Numbers:** ~400–500

**Slaves & Experimental Thralls (Lvl –1 to 3)**

* **Role:** Test subjects, failed magical hybrids, or bound monsters.

* **Statblock Base:** Quaggoth (Lvl 3), Grimlock (Lvl 2), Troglodyte (Lvl 2).

* **Twist:** Some are modified (fiend-tainted, alchemically enhanced).

* **Numbers:** ~1,000–1,500

**House Specialization (Mechanical Hooks)**

* **Faction Benefit:** All Veythrae mages can **layer shadow on fire spells** — when they cast a fire spell in dim light or darkness, enemies hit must save vs concealment (flat check 5) until end of next turn.

* **Tactics:** Always soften enemies with battlefield magic, then unleash demons. They prefer shock-and-awe over grinding attrition.

* **Weakness:** Overconfident; expend apprentices recklessly, leaving them vulnerable if their high-level casters are isolated.

**Adventure Hooks**

* **Mage-Hunting Party:** Lvl 9 Wizard + 4 Shadowguard (Lvl 5) hunting surface adventurers.

* **Laboratory Defense:** PCs stumble into a fiend-binding ritual gone wrong. Circle of 3 Arcane Councilors + summoned demons.

* **Matron’s Wrath:** If directly opposed, the Matron uses devastating 9th-level shadowfire to annihilate intruders.

👉 House Xilrath = disciplined **military machine**.
👉 House Veythrae = arrogant **arcane powerhouse**.
Together, they form a **tense alliance**: the sword and the wand of the city.

Would you like me to **map Veythrae’s compound (estate)** to the *Sorcerer Academy/Sorcere* analog in D3 — with their demon pits, shadowforges, and mage towers detailed — so it slots neatly into your city map?
