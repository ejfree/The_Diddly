# Drow House Overview

Excellent ‚Äî let‚Äôs make each house feel like a **living faction** by giving it a **Matron Mother**, **two leadership tiers**, and the **company/patrol** they command. I‚Äôll do this in the PF2e style so you can drop them straight into play.

## **House Xilrath (Militarists)**

*The war engine of the city.*

Would you like me to also create a **Council of Houses roster** (seating order, voting blocs, and how each house wields its company in politics) so you can run intrigue scenes like you would a battlefield?

Perfect ‚Äî here‚Äôs a structured setup for your **forward Underdark drow city**. Two dominant noble houses control the war effort, while four minor houses circle them, each with their own role and grudges.

**Major Houses
House Xilrath (Matron House ‚Äì War Doctrine)**

* **Specialty:** Heavy infantry, elite priestesses of Lolth, and logistics of war.

* **Population/Troops:** ~1,200 drow (400 elite soldiers, 200 priestesses/adepts, 600 retainers & commoners).

* **Role in War:** They‚Äôve overseen the stockpiling of supplies for two decades ‚Äî fungus farms, roth√© herds, and slave-trains are all tied to Xilrath‚Äôs economic web.

* **Personality:** Pragmatic but ruthless. Matron Mother Xilrath believes victory on the surface will cement her house as the undisputed rulers of the region.

* **Rivalry:** Secretly despises the magical supremacy of House Veythrae.

**House Veythrae (Arcane House ‚Äì Shadowfire)**

* **Specialty:** War mages, arcane laboratories, and ritual shadowbinding.

* **Population/Troops:** ~900 drow (300 mage cadres, 100 high priestesses aligned with arcane rites, 500 servants/retainers).

* **Role in War:** Produce weapons and armor enhanced by shadow-forged enchantments, train battle-wizards, and oversee summoned demons bound to fight on the front lines.

* **Personality:** Arrogant, elitist, obsessed with magical superiority. Their matron openly claims Lolth favors intellect and sorcery over brute force.

* **Rivalry:** Hates House Xilrath‚Äôs militaristic pragmatism but knows they need their army.

**Minor Houses
House Dravun (Beastmasters)**

* **Specialty:** Quaggoth slave-troops, giant spiders, and roth√© herds.

* **Troops:** ~400 drow, plus ~1,200 beast/enslaved auxiliaries.

* **Role in War:** Provide shock troops and terror units, spiders bred to climb siege walls and tunnels.

* **Quirk:** Worship Lolth as the Great Spider literally, emphasizing monstrous allies.

**House Thalmyr (Whisperers)**

* **Specialty:** Espionage, assassination, and surface scouting.

* **Troops:** ~350 drow, mostly rogues, spies, and small strike teams.

* **Role in War:** Mapping surface strongholds, infiltrating local politics, and assassinating enemy leaders before the campaign begins.

* **Quirk:** They control the city‚Äôs information networks, from tavern rumors to captured spies.

**House Velouryn (Merchants & Smugglers)**

* **Specialty:** Trade networks (both Underdark and surface), slaves, poisons, and contraband.

* **Troops:** ~300 drow, light on warriors but heavy on mercantile power.

* **Role in War:** Handle smuggling routes to the surface, supply chains, and maintain ‚Äúneutral‚Äù connections even with rivals.

* **Quirk:** Many suspect they deal with duergar and surface humans despite Lolthite prohibitions.

**House Zhaelor (Fanatics)**

* **Specialty:** Zealous priesthood, fanatical warbands, religious devotion.

* **Troops:** ~250 drow, mostly zealots and clerics.

* **Role in War:** Serve as the city‚Äôs inquisitors, rooting out heresy and inspiring soldiers with violent sermons.

* **Quirk:** Consider House Veythrae dangerously heretical for their arcane independence.

**Political Web**

* **Xilrath & Veythrae** are forced into alliance (military vs magical dominance).

* **Dravun** is a reliable ally to Xilrath (soldiers need beasts).

* **Thalmyr** balances between both majors, selling information to whoever pays.

* **Velouryn** pretends neutrality but secretly funds Veythrae‚Äôs experiments.

* **Zhaelor** threatens everyone with ‚Äúholy judgment‚Äù but doesn‚Äôt have the numbers to dominate.

üëâ This setup gives you **clear rivalries, alliances, and potential for betrayal** once the war starts.
Do you want me to also **detail the city itself** (layout, key districts, and a central temple/fortress) so it feels like a living Underdark metropolis?
