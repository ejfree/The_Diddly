# Xilthraen Overview


Got it — if you’re leaning into the **Forgotten Realms Underdark stereotype** (Lolthite hierarchy, slave-driven economy, martial focus) but want it transplanted into Eberron, here’s a good scale for your **forward-leaning, war-supporting city**:

**Population Scale**

* **Small city, war-footing:** **8,000–12,000 drow**This keeps it “smaller” compared to vast centers like Menzoberranzan (~20k+ drow) but still large enough to project power upward.

* **Non-drow residents:** add another **3,000–6,000** thralls, mercenaries, and slaves (duergar, goblinoids, quaggoths, grimlocks, maybe a few captured surface races).

* **Total population:** roughly **12,000–18,000**.

**Demographic Breakdown (drow only)**

* **Noble houses & retainers:** ~10% (800–1,200)

* **Priestesses of Lolth & clergy:** ~5% (400–600)

* **Professional soldiery/raiding troops:** ~25% (2,000–3,000)

* **Mage cadre (academy students, battle-wizards):** ~5–8% (400–1,000)

* **Artisans, farmers (fungus, rothé herds), laborers:** ~40% (3,200–4,800)

* **Criminals, houseless, underclass:** ~10% (800–1,200)

**Military Standing Force**
Since this city has spent **two decades stockpiling for war**, its military is disproportionately large:

* **Standing drow soldiers:** ~2,500–3,000 (mix of elite warriors, house troops, and mercenary-captains).

* **Slave/auxiliary troops:** ~1,500–2,000 (low-tier infantry, fodder).

* **Reserve (militia, half-trained commoners):** another ~2,000 if mobilized.
That gives you an **immediate war band of ~4,000–5,000**, with more if the city empties itself into a campaign.

Would you like me to sketch **one or two major noble houses** that dominate this city (with rough troop counts, specialties, and rivalries)? That way you’ve got ready factions to drop into play.
