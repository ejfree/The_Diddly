# G1 Upper Level


The map shows the huge timber stronghold of the local clan of hill giants. All outer walls are of logs of at least *3* feet in diameter. Inner
walls dividing rooms and the like are about *2* feet thick, and doors are great iron-bouad log affairs of 1-meter thickness-single doors being approximately *7* feet wide and *10* feet high.

All inside floors are of stone. Ceiling height varies from about *16* feet at the edges to *32* feet at the center, and there are great blackened rafters above which hold up the roof. The Steading is in a nasty damp area, where hard rain is a daily occurrence and wet fogs a nightly event.

A DC22 check is required to open all doors because of their great size and weight. Doors stay open if left that way. Location *22* is an open stockyard, while rooms *23-25* are an outbuilding which is connected to the main lodge by a huge palisade of tree trunks *3* feet in diameter and **30** feet tall.

**Burning it Down: All** wood in the place is very damp. (Normal fire has only a *2* % chance per round of burning or setting the place afire, and even magical fires have only an 8% chance per round of the same.) If the party should manage to set the upper works of the Steading aflame, they will be forced to wait a week before trying to discover a way into the lower (dungeon) level, for hot embers will prevent entry before this period of time. **All** loot from the upper works is lost in such a fire, but all giants from location *11* of the upper level escape to safety in the lower level, going to location *26. 40K of treasure on the map, not counting the magical stuff being worn, if any*
