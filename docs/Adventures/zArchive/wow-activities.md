Quick Introduction with the RA. Come into Lisa’s Room

Cross between dojo and arcane mechanics lab. Room is somewhat half and half. But she does serve excellent tea. On one wall is a set of very old looking weapons. They give off artifact level power.

Lisa Introduction

So let’s do some introductions. Standard stuff, name, where you are from, what you want to study. Also include something interesting about yourself as well as the craziest thing you have ever seen. I will start.

I am in my drake year here at the Diddly. I choose to study Archano Mechanics, but please keep that between us. If my grandmother know, she would flip her shit. She is a guest lecturer in the Prophecy department and thinks I will follow in her footsteps. But that stuff is boring.

I lived a pretty boring life so far, even though I grew up outside of Argonessen. It wasn’t all bad, I was treated like a princess. But I was also limited in where I could go and that sucked.

Craziest thing I have seen is that I once saw a cactus talk.

I also saw an owl & a shadow that could talk also.

Take the rest of the day to enjoy the campus, check out the gym, dinner & breakfast & lunch will always be at the commons. This takes as long as they want. The commons is across the bridge to the south. It is beachside and offers lovely views of the water quad.

 Next morning is Class and we meet the profesor…Skytalon. Then their TA, Murky takes them to their assigned loot bubble. Where is promptly starts sunning himself as you explore. The area. He will call a halt in a few hours to go back. Eggies are not allowed in the loot bubbles unsupervised. That doesnt apply to me, but I can’t remove anything from your bubble, or any bubble that I am not authorized to remove loot on. I dont know how it works, but this one kid a few years ago, name was Ick, agile & lithe black dragon who figured out how to manipulate the planar space to the bubble and inject himself. The figured it out pretty quick and while he was inside a bubble it disappeared.
