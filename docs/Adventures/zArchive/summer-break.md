# Summer Break

Grandma wants a flight for summer interns‚Ä¶

Summer Interns for Sivi‚Äôs Libation Emporium. This opportunity is available through your RA, Lisa, and her grandmother, newly hired Professor of prophecy, Alyssa Siviridion. While initially you thought this was some boring corporate thing, a blue dragon working for the Emporium met with your team with a clarification on the nature of the assignment. This is a sensitive operation and requires assuming a non-draconic form for the duration of the assignment. The is a special tea, Q‚ÄôBarran First Flush, that has been a constant trade item from Q‚ÄôBarra to Korranberg/Sharn for a lengthy time. It has been disrupted and we need some troubleshooters to go find out why. We have good intelligence on where this is happening but need a team to investigate it locally. And the only want to get there is on a boat disguised as guards.

400gp for 1 month 1/4 up front
300gp if 2nd month is required - paid out at end
