### Adventure: **A Heated Experiment**

**Synopsis:**
The PCs are assisting or observing a practical demonstration in the **Intro to Elemental Mechanics** lab. Professor Deepcurrent [[Professor Deepcurrent]], an eccentric sea dragon, explains that their task is to balance the energy flow between the portals to the Elemental Planes of Fire and Water, and the heat dump to Phlegethon. However, when a mishap occurs, the experiment spirals out of control, summoning chaotic mephits and leading to a climactic showdown with elemental lords.

---

### **Setup**

- **Location:** A large laboratory with three control stations (50 feet apart in an equilateral triangle). The room is clean but filled with arcane mechanisms and glowing sigils. In the center, a transparent opening reveals a swirling “combinator,” an unstable magical vortex.

- **Professor Grittlespark:** A brass dragon in a smaller humanoid form. She explains the mechanics of balancing the portals, her enthusiasm barely masking the experiment's inherent danger.

---

### **Phase 1: Balancing Act (Mini-Game)**

**Objective:** The PCs must balance the energy input from the elemental planes by interacting with the three control stations. Each lever affects the experiment's overall balance, and a failure summons a chaotic mephit.

#### Mechanics

- Each station has **3 levers**, which must be actuated in a specific order:
  - **Station 1 (Water Portal):** Use *Athletics*, *Thievery*, or *Arcana*. Each lever adjusts the flow of water energy.
  - **Station 2 (Fire Portal):** Use *Athletics*, *Thievery*, or *Arcana*. Each lever increases fire energy flow but deals **1d4-1 fire damage** per attempt (scaling with lever difficulty).
  - **Station 3 (Heat Dump to Phlegethon):** Requires interaction with a small devil operator who can be influenced with *Deception*, *Society*, or *Intimidation*. Each lever increases heat-dumping capacity.

#### DC Progression:

- Lever 1: DC 13

- Lever 2: DC 16

- Lever 3: DC 19

**Failures:**
On a failed check, a mephit (matching the portal’s energy) emerges:

- **Water Mephit:** Uses ranged water blasts and slippery terrain.

- **Fire Mephit:** Breathes fire and ignites nearby objects.

- **Steam Mephit:** Combines water and fire attacks, creating scalding steam clouds.

Mephits have basic stats appropriate for Level 1-2 creatures, and each one takes about two rounds to handle.

---

### **Phase 2: Catastrophic Imbalance**

**Trigger Event:**
When more than **3 failures** occur or if the PCs activate the levers out of balance, the combinator in the center becomes unstable. The transparent floor cracks, and energy bursts forth, creating a massive explosion unless the PCs quickly act to stabilize it.

#### Final Task:

- One PC at each station must perform a check to stabilize the combinator, with a **DC 20 Arcana, Crafting, or Nature** check.

- If successful, the explosion is mitigated, but the lab is still heavily damaged.

- On failure, the combinator detonates, dealing **4d6 damage (Reflex DC 18 for half)** to all creatures in the room and summoning the elemental lords.

---

### **Phase 3: The Elemental Lords Appear**

After the explosion (or successful stabilization), the **Elemental Lords of Fire, Water, and Steam** emerge, furious at the experiment's recklessness. Each one blames the others for the chaos, and the PCs must negotiate, fight, or cleverly redirect their anger.

#### Elemental Lords:

- **Lord Ignus (Fire):** A humanoid figure made of flames. He demands retribution for meddling with his plane.

- **Lady Aquara (Water):** A regal, serpentine figure of flowing water. She is more diplomatic but accuses the group of disturbing the balance.

- **Lord Vaporr (Steam):** A chaotic mix of boiling water and hissing vapor. He is furious at being “created” without permission.

**Tactics:**

- Combat is possible but challenging. Each lord fights with Level 4 elemental abilities (fire blasts, water jets, steam clouds).

- Diplomacy or Deception (DC 18) can appease one of the lords and convince them to help resolve the issue.

- Creative uses of Arcana, Crafting, or magical items can stabilize the situation or redirect their ire.

### **Resolution**

**Ending Options:**
1. **Explosion and Escape:** The combinator detonates, forcing the PCs to flee as the lab collapses. The elemental lords vanish, but the PCs survive to report the incident to Professor Grittlespark.
2. **Peaceful Resolution:** The PCs stabilize the lab and calm the elemental lords, earning praise from Professor Grittlespark and avoiding sanctions.
3. **Victory Through Combat:** The PCs defeat the elemental lords, but the lab is ruined. Professor Grittlespark is impressed by their strength but warns of political repercussions from the elemental planes.

---

### **Rewards**

- **XP:** Standard XP for defeating mephits, stabilizing the combinator, and resolving the elemental lords’ appearance (combat or diplomacy).

- **Loot:** A magical trinket or scroll gifted by one of the elemental lords for resolving the situation diplomatically.

- **Reputation:** Favor with Professor Grittlespark, leading to future opportunities in the Archano-Mechanics department.

This adventure provides a mix of skill challenges, combat, and roleplay, ensuring a dynamic and engaging session!

Lets create an adventure for our 4 level 2 pathfinder 2e characters. The location is a lab classroom for the **Intro to Elemental Mechanics**  class, Archano-Mechanics. In this classroom there are 3 stations that are in the corners of an equilateral triangle that is 50 feet per side. The center of the room has a transparent opening to the “combinator below”

One station controls the portal to the elemental plane of water. There are 3 levers on this panel and can be actuated. Requires athletics, thievery or arcana DC that scale up slightly with each lever. The first one should be easy.

One station controls the portal to the elemental plane of fire. There are 3 levers on this panel and can be actuated. Requires athletics, thievery or arcana DC that scale up slightly with each lever. The first one should be easy. Take some damage, d4-1 that escalates similar to the DC

One station controls the portal to a heat dump, which is actually in Phlegethon, the 4th level of hell where the excess heat is contributed to the forges there. This is a contractual agreement with the college and the arch devil Belial. There are 3 levers on this panel and can be actuated by the devil that is sitting beside the lever and appears to be the operator. Requires deception, society or intimidation DC that scale up slightly with each lever. The first one should be easy.

The adventure should start with a mini-game that balances the inputs and heat dump. If there is a failure, a mephit of the appropriate type will be created.

At the end everything should explode, or potentially be saved, but there is still a final scene with 3 Elemental Lords or water, fire and steam.
