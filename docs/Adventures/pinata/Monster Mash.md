# Monster Mash




*The party is tasked by a local druid circle to investigate and close a portal to Lamania that has opened in a sacred grove. The portal is unstable and leaking wild energy, which has begun to transform the surrounding forest and creatures into aggressive, primal versions of themselves. The druid circle provides the party with healing potions and some basic guidance on how to disrupt the portal’s flow, but warns them that waves of creatures from Lamania will pour out to protect it.*

### Portal Mechanics

- **Portal Activation**: The portal spawns one wave of monsters every time the party disrupts the flow of energy.

- **Healing Intervals**: After each wave, the portal goes dormant for 5 minutes, allowing the party to heal. Each character may drink one healing potion (2d8+4) after every wave. 

### Wave 1: Wild Wolves Moderate
The first wave emerges from the portal in the form of fierce, otherworldly wolves with glowing eyes. These primal creatures are fast and aggressive.

- **Enemies**: 4 Primal Wolves (Treat as Wolves with +2 HP and a +1 to attack rolls to reflect their wild nature)

- **Tactics**: Wolves will attempt to flank and use their "trip" ability to knock party members down.

- **Reward**: 2 additional healing potions can be found on the ground after the battle, glowing with residual portal energy.

### Wave 2: Elemental Spirits - Severe
The portal shifts, and from its depths emerge creatures made of raw elemental energy: small earth and air elementals. These creatures reflect the chaotic nature of Lamania, embodying the plane’s natural forces.

- **Enemies**: 2 Small Earth Elementals, Gluttonous Geode, Living Boulder, earth scamp

- **Tactics**: Earth elementals will target the strongest melee combatants, while air elementals will use their superior mobility to harry spellcasters and ranged attackers.

- **Environmental Effect**: The ground shakes violently during this wave, causing unsteady footing. Every round, characters must succeed on a DC 10 Reflex save or fall prone.

- **Reward**: One Elemental Gem (Air) can be found among the debris after the battle, which can be used to summon a Small Air Elemental for 1 minute.

### Wave 3: Fey Tricksters
The portal darkens and a pair of mischievous fey, alongside their treant companion, step forth. The fey are illusionists, using their magic to confuse the party, while the treant brings raw physical might.

- **Enemies**: 2 Quickling Fey (Use "Pixie" stats but remove invisibility and replace with +10 to speed), 1 Twig Blight

- **Tactics**: The fey will use *color spray* and illusions to disrupt the party’s coordination, while the Twig Blight grapples or entangles weaker members.

- **Environmental Effect**: The battlefield becomes shrouded in mist, causing all creatures to have concealment (20% miss chance).

- **Reward**: A bundle of magical herbs that grants the party one additional healing potion for each member.

### Wave 4: Primal Dire Bear
A huge beast, maddened by the primal energies of Lamania, emerges. The portal pulses with power as this Dire Bear, glowing with green energy, charges the party. This wave is a true test of strength and endurance.

- **Enemy**: 1 Primal Dire Bear (Treat as a Dire Bear but with +10 HP and advantage on saving throws against spells)

- **Tactics**: The Dire Bear will target the nearest character with its powerful claws and attempt to maul them. It has a special frenzy ability, allowing it to make an extra attack if it takes more than 10 damage in one round.

- **Environmental Effect**: Roots and vines constantly grow and writhe during this wave. Every round, characters must make a DC 10 Reflex save or be entangled for one round.

- **Reward**: The party finds a minor nature-themed magic item—such as a *Cloak of Resistance +1* or *Amulet of Natural Armor +1*—growing from the bear’s fur.

### Wave 5: Nature’s Avatar
The portal flickers as a final, mighty being emerges. This creature, an Avatar of Nature, is a composite of multiple animals—part lion, part eagle, part snake. It is intelligent and speaks to the party, warning them that closing the portal will break the link between Lamania and the Material Plane.

- **Enemy**: 1 Avatar of Nature (Use "Chimera" stats, but reduce HP to 55 to balance for 1st level characters, and replace the fire breath with a thunderous roar dealing 2d6 sonic damage in a 30-foot cone)

- **Tactics**: The Avatar will use its superior movement to fly and strike from range, focusing on hit-and-run tactics. It uses its roar to disrupt the party’s actions and will target spellcasters first.

- **Environmental Effect**: As the final wave, the portal is at its most unstable. Every round, wild energy surges, causing random effects (roll 1d6):
  1. The ground trembles, causing everyone to make a Reflex save or fall prone.
  2. A bolt of lightning strikes a random character for 1d6 electrical damage.
  3. Healing energy surges, allowing all creatures to heal 1d6 HP.
  4. Everyone gains haste for one round.
  5. Plants entangle a random character, causing them to become immobilized until they make a Strength check.
  6. The air becomes heavy, and all creatures must make a Fortitude save or be fatigued.

- **Reward**: The Avatar leaves behind a magical stone that grants the party the ability to close the portal safely. If they fail, the portal remains open, and more creatures from Lamania could spill into the world.

### Conclusion

If the party successfully closes the portal, the forest begins to return to normal, and the druid circle rewards them with a minor magical boon (each character receives a nature-themed potion or scroll). The druid elder also warns them that while the portal is closed for now, Lamania’s influence may not be gone forever. If they fail, they must decide whether to flee and seek more help or try to contain the threat before more creatures from Lamania emerge.

This adventure provides a challenging sequence of encounters, allowing the party to engage with different types of creatures and environmental effects while still giving them opportunities to recover between waves.
