# The Alchemist’s Sigil Seal

**Puzzle Trap: The Alchemist’s Sigil Seal
Room Layout**

* **Center Disc**: Four slots in a circle (N, E, S, W). Each slot can be set to one of the four alchemical sigils.

* **Pointer**: A glowing crystal arrow in the center, showing which slot is currently being modified.

* **Lever**: Rotates the pointer clockwise (N → E → S → W → N).

* **Sigil Imprints on Wall**: Four carved symbols glowing faintly. Pressing one etches that symbol into the slot the pointer is on.

**The Four Sigils (Alchemical)**
1. **Fire (Triangle)** – represents combustion, destruction, heat.
3. **Water (Circle with Line)** – represents dissolution, purification, and decay.
5. **Blood (Droplet)** – represents sacrifice, life essence, reagents of the body.
7. **Gold (Sunburst)** – represents perfection, eternal achievement, transmutation goal.

**Correct Set (the Alchemist’s Formula)**

* To mirror the secret recipe the alchemist jealously guarded, the sigils must be arranged clockwise:
    * **North: Gold (Sunburst)****East: Fire (Triangle)****South: Blood (Droplet)****West: Water (Circle)**This sequence is the alchemist’s “Great Work”:

**Gold is born of Fire, Fire is fed by Blood, Blood is washed in Water, and Water purifies into Gold.**

* **Result**: The center disc descends, opening a vault or disabling the statue room’s fire-grate trap. The smell of heated metal briefly fills the room.

**Incorrect Sets & Alchemist’s Punishments**
The alchemist deliberately rigged the seal so wrong combinations unleash “failed experiment” effects:
1. **All Fire**    * **Explosion of Flame:** The circle belches a gout of fire, scorching everything in the room.
    * Walls blacken, and the smell of brimstone lingers.
2. **All Water**    * **Flooding Vapors:** The chamber fills with choking alchemical steam.
    * Creatures cough violently, taking acid damage and suffering obscured vision.
3. **All Blood**    * **Vampiric Drain:** Crimson mist rises from the disc, draining HP from creatures and channeling it into the stone.
    * Anyone reduced to 0 collapses into a husk.
4. **All Gold**    * **Alchemical Calcification:** A transmutation surge hardens skin into brittle crystal.
    * Affected creatures become slowed and vulnerable to bludgeoning until cured.
5. **Opposite Pairs (North/South match, East/West match)**    * **Unstable Reaction:** The circle glows violently, then detonates with thunderous force.
    * Creatures are pushed back as if an alchemical bomb exploded.
6. **Chaos Pattern (all four different but in wrong order)**    * The seal “hisses” like a boiling crucible.
    * Everyone in the room takes splash acid damage, and the lever locks for 1 minute while the system resets.

**Atmosphere**

* The walls here are etched with alchemical diagrams: circles, formulae, goblin script describing “purity,” “strength,” and “the true elixir.”

* Every press of a sigil sends a ripple of color across the floor, like mixing reagents.

* Incorrect sets always leave **residue** — char on the walls, acid burns on the floor, dried blood stains, or flecks of gold dust that fade quickly.

⚗️ Would you like me to also create a **few scribbled notes or wall clues** left by the alchemist that players could discover, so they can piece the correct sequence together in-game?

Excellent — here are a handful of **alchemist’s clues** you can scatter across the tomb. They’re written in the voice of the Emperor’s alchemist, cryptic but decipherable.

**Clues to the Sigil Puzzle
1. Scrawled Note (Laboratory, on a cracked slate)**

*"Gold alone is meaningless — soft, corruptible. But when tempered by flame, it takes form.
Let fire follow gold, as the crucible follows the ore."*
➡ Points to **Gold (N) → Fire (E)**.

**2. Wall Carving (Near the Office, partly eroded)**

*"No fire burns without blood to feed it. The body gives, the flame takes. So it has always been."*
➡ Points to **Fire (E) → Blood (S)**.

**3. Broken Clay Tablet (In the Altar Room, fallen from a shelf)**

*"Blood, unwashed, festers. The water cleanses the stain and carries it away.
Only through dissolution may life return."*
➡ Points to **Blood (S) → Water (W)**.

**4. Scribbled Margin Note (Lab journal, half-burned)**

*"The circle must close. Water cools and refines — and from it, the perfected metal is drawn.
Thus does the work begin anew."*
➡ Points to **Water (W) → Gold (N)**.

**5. Red Herring (Optional – for misdirection)**
On a bottle in the lab, labeled in Goblin:

*"All fire purifies. Begin always with flame."*
➡ Could trick players into putting **Fire** at North.

**How They Fit Together**
When pieced together, the cycle emerges:

**Gold → Fire → Blood → Water → Gold**

**Extra Flavor**

* The notes might be written in *Goblin shorthand*, requiring checks (Arcana, Alchemy, or Linguistics) to interpret.

* Some pieces might be **physically damaged**:
    * Words obscured with acid burns.
    * Sentences ending mid-thought.
    * Blood smears across a phrase.
This makes them feel like authentic scraps instead of perfect instructions.

⚗️ Do you want me to write these **exactly as handouts/props** (short phrases formatted as old scraps players could be given at the table)?
