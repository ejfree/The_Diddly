  - **Pressure Plates**: Several plates in the floor trigger spears to shoot up from the ground. Characters must make DC 15 Reflex saves or take 1d8 piercing damage.

  - **Abilities**: The lieutenant has the ability to summon reinforcements (1-2 Warforged Scouts), cast defensive spells, and wield a pair of scimitars with deadly efficiency.
  - **Tactics**: The lieutenant will start by summoning scouts for assistance, using ranged spells, and engaging in melee only when necessary. He will use the environment, including energy conduits or repair stations, to his advantage.

### Additional Treasure Throughout the Outpost:

These encounters provide a variety of tactical challenges and immersive lore-based threats that align with the warforged culture of this secret outpost. The treasure reflects warforged technology, mechanical tools, and items useful for lower-level characters in PF2e.

Just inside the border with Talendra, bordering on Lake Cyre is an secret outpost station of the Cyran nation, which no longer exists after the mourning event. The entire area is covered with a mist comprised of alternating positive & negative energy. This means that no living or undead creature can survive in this area. The only creatures that can thrive are war forged robots.

This whole robot culture is lead by “Lobster” AKA the Lord of Blades, who is a CR20 monster. This small outpost is populated by these war forged robots. Create encounters for 5, 2nd level characters in the PF2e system. There should be 2 patrols, 4 standard room encounters, 1 room with multiple traps, and a final boss. Include appropriate treasure as well
