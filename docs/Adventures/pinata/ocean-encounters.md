# Ocean Encounters



Absolutely! Here's a flavorful and balanced list of **non-monster, non-combat encounters, hazards, and events** for a **Level 4 party in Eberron**, specifically for an ocean voyage. These are categorized by **harmless**, **moderate**, and **extreme** to help you scale tension, pacing, and resource management.

All entries are designed with **Pathfinder 2e mechanics** in mind, using **Exploration Mode, Skill Challenges, Environmental Hazards**, or **Roleplay Scenarios** rather than direct combat.

---

## ‚öì Harmless Events (Flavor, Roleplay, Low Stakes)

1. **Bioluminescent Tide**
   - At night, the sea glows in shifting colors as bioluminescent plankton bloom. PCs can make **Nature or Arcana checks (DC 15)** to learn this only happens near underwater manifest zones to Thelanis.

2. **Stormlight Mirage**
   - A fleeting mirage appears on the horizon: an upside-down floating city. An **Occultism or Arcana (DC 16)** check reveals it's a mirage caused by planar interference‚Äîlikely Xoriat or Dal Quor.

3. **Curious Sea Elemental (Minor)**
   - A tiny sea elemental takes interest in the ship, playfully mimicking crew members. Dealing with it requires **Diplomacy or Nature (DC 14)** checks. It leaves after an hour.

4. **Ghost Ship in the Fog (Illusion)**
   - A spooky ghost ship passes in dense fog but vanishes on approach. No danger‚Äîjust eerie. A **Religion or Arcana (DC 15)** check confirms it's a harmless echo from Dolurrh.

5. **Korranberg Message Bottle**
   - PCs find a sealed message in a bottle from the Korranberg Chronicle offering a writing contract for adventurous tales. May spark side quests.

6. **Food Overboard**
   - A barrel of pickled eels bursts and falls into the sea. Sailors panic slightly. Players can assist recovery via **Athletics or Sailing Lore (DC 14)**.

7. **Magical Aurora**
   - The sky glows with multicolored auroras. Casters sense a subtle magic surge. A **Spellcraft or Arcana (DC 13)** reveals the aurora may be a natural link to the plane of Syrania.

8. **Hatching Skysquid Eggs**
   - Tiny, floating skysquid hatch and briefly attach to the ship's rigging. They glow, float, and disappear into the sky. Cute and harmless.

~~9. **Drunken Crew Games**
   - The crew gets a bit too celebratory and starts a betting game. PCs can join in for coin and roleplay. Use **Performance, Deception, or Diplomacy (DC 14)**.~~

~~10. **Lost Pet Parrot**
   - A parrot from another ship lands on deck, shouting strange commands in Goblin. Can be befriended with **Nature or Animal Empathy (DC 13)**.~~

---

## üåä Moderate Hazards (Skill Challenges, Delays, Minor Spell/Item Use)

1. **Rogue Wave**
   - A sudden surge smashes across the deck. **Reflex Save (DC 18)** or be knocked prone and potentially lose unsecured gear. Crafting or Survival checks help secure the ship post-wave.

2. **Mana-Slick Waters**

3. **Sargasso Entanglement**
   - Thick seaweed grips the ship. 3-round skill challenge: PCs must use **Athletics, Nature, or Acrobatics (DC 18)** to cut or burn free before the tide shifts.

4. **Psychic Whispers from the Deep**
   - The party hears faint, haunting whispers. **Will Save (DC 19)** or suffer mild confusion (flat check 5+ to focus for 1 hour). Source unknown‚Äîties to Dal Quor or Xoriat.

5. **Malfunctioning Bound Elemental**
   - The ship's elemental engine sputters. Use **Crafting or Arcana (DC 19)** to stabilize it. Failure reduces speed or causes one-time damage (2d6).

6. **Navigational Confusion**
   - A minor planar rift shifts magnetic orientation. PCs must realign charts using **Survival or Sailing Lore (DC 17)**. Failure causes a 1-day delay.

7. **Ancient Draconic Rune Buoy**
   - The ship nears a floating obsidian rune buoy. Arcane magic surges. Interacting requires **Arcana, Occultism, or Religion (DC 20)**. Harmless if studied; dangerous if tampered.


8. **Arcane Contamination Spill**
   - The ship passes through an area where a lightning rail shipment of raw arcane crystals was dumped into the sea decades ago. Magic flickers unpredictably.
   - **Arcana (DC 18)** to recognize the source and mitigate magical interference.
   - **Effect**: For 1 hour, all spellcasters roll a flat check (DC 5) or have their spells fizzle (no slot lost). Dispel Magic can temporarily calm the field.

9. **Blightwind From Mabar**
   - A cold wind blows from an unseen direction, draining warmth and color.
   - PCs must pass **Fortitude saves (DC 19)** or become **enfeebled 1** for 1 hour.
   - **Religion (DC 18)** identifies it as a minor bleedthrough from the Plane of Negative Energy (Mabar).

~~10. **Drifting Lightning-Keg Buoy**
   - A House Cannith keg of alchemical lightning drifts half-submerged in the water. It's unstable.
   - **Thievery or Crafting (DC 19)** to disable or recover it safely.
   - Mishandling causes **3d6 electricity damage** in a 10-foot radius.~~

~~11. **Runoff from Stormreach Experiments**
   - Mutated algae from House Vadalis spills across the water. Touching it causes hallucinations or rashes.
   - **Medicine (DC 18)** or **Nature (DC 19)** to treat exposed crew.
   - Failing to act within the hour causes the affected to become **stupefied 1** for 24 hours.~~

12. **Sea Shards (Kythri Manifestation)**
   - The ocean surface splinters into briefly solid shards of water.
   - Navigating requires **Sailing Lore, Acrobatics, or Reflex Saves (DC 19)**.
   - Failure causes the ship to take hull damage (5d6 slashing). A **Planar Lore or Arcana (DC 20)** check helps chart a stable path.

13. **Mind Echo Relic**
   - A sailor finds a glowing crystal bobbing on the tide. Touching it floods their mind with alien thoughts.
   - **Occultism (DC 21)** reveals it to be a Quori memory shard from Dal Quor.
   - Interaction requires **Will Save (DC 19)** or suffer a 1-round confusion effect and persistent haunting dreams.

14. **Navigational Dissonance**
   - All compasses point in different directions. Maps go blank for 1 hour.
   - Requires **Survival (DC 20)** or **Arcana (DC 21)** to realign the ship's heading. Failure causes 1d4 days of off-course travel.

## üå™Ô∏è Extreme Events (Resource Drain, RP Fallout, Dangerous Hazard)

~~1. **Manifest Zone Shift**
   - The ship crosses into a shifting manifest zone connected to **Risia (Plane of Ice)** or **Kythri (Chaos)**. Sudden weather or gravity changes. **Endurance, Reflex Saves, or Arcana (DC 21‚Äì23)** to avoid damage or disorientation. Can last 1‚Äì3 hours.~~

2. **Temporal Distortion**
   - Time flows strangely for a day. PCs may age slightly or find the voyage skips forward or backward. **Will Save (DC 22)** or be out of sync for the day (penalty to initiative and reactions).

3. **Planar Fog (Dal Quor Bleedthrough)**
   - A dense, sleep-inducing fog envelops the ship. PCs must pass **Fortitude Saves (DC 22)** each hour or suffer fatigue or fall into magical slumber. Dreamlike visions may reveal secrets or prophetic images.

4. **Living Shipwood**
   - A section of the ship‚Äôs hull reanimates from a long-dead Dryad tree. PCs must **calm or subdue it (Nature or Diplomacy, DC 24)** or risk it damaging the vessel from within.

5. **Cursed Cargo**
   - A crate of contraband recovered earlier contains a dormant curse tied to the Shadow Marches. Once opened, it infects the crew with a compulsion or mild madness. **Counteract check (DC 23)** to cleanse it.


~~6. **Ley Line Wild Surge**
   - The ship crosses a volatile underwater ley line. Spellcasters feel power surge or collapse.
   - For 1d4 hours, all spellcasters must roll **d6** when casting:
     - 1 = Spell fails, no slot lost
     - 2‚Äì5 = Normal
     - 6 = Empowered (one damage die increases or effect extends 50%)
   - **Arcana (DC 22)** to stabilize the surge temporarily with a ritual or redirect magical flow.~~

7. **Ethereal Convergence**
   - An intersection with the Ethereal Plane causes ghostly duplicates of the crew to walk the deck.
   - PCs must use **Religion (DC 22)** or **Occultism (DC 23)** to prevent the real and ethereal forms from merging‚Äîotherwise, some characters suffer **Persistent Mental Damage** (1d6 per hour until cleansed).

8. **Rite of the Deepwater Giant**
   - A sea elf delegation appears unannounced and demands a tribute for safe passage through their ancestral trench. They offer a riddle or test.
   - **Diplomacy (DC 24)** or **Society (DC 22)** to negotiate a non-violent solution.
   - Failure results in the sea elves cursing the ship (sail speed reduced by half until removed by Remove Curse or a divine offering at a shrine).

9. **Night of the Silver Moons**
   - For one night, both moons glow simultaneously and brightly. The ship is briefly shifted into **Lanaros**, a subrealm of Syrania.
   - PCs can **attempt to glean prophecy or forgotten knowledge** by meditating during the event.
   - However, this also invites extraplanar attention: all PCs must roll **Will Saves (DC 23)** or receive strange celestial brands that give them minor powers (or burdens) for a week.

10. **Blood Tide**
   - The ocean runs red and thick. Animals go silent.
   - **Survival, Nature, or Religion (DC 22)** identifies it as a temporary crossing with a demiplane of Rakshasa origin.
   - All divine magic is suppressed for 24 hours. Clerics must pass **Will Saves (DC 20)** each morning to prepare spells.
