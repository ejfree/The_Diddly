# Ogre

Where one dreams and the other doubts,
The Twin-Watcher bears the mark of storm.
Their scouts are of flesh and fat and fury,
But behind them march the old blood—

Great! Here's a complete encounter breakdown for a **mid-level (Level 5) party** exploring an **elven glade overrun by ogre slavers**, including **traps, slave pens, key NPCs, and tactical layout**. This can be scaled for a party of **4–5 PCs around level 5** for Pathfinder 2E.

**🗺️ LOCATION OVERVIEW: "The Rootbound Glade"**
Once a serene fey-touched elven refuge, this forest glade has been desecrated by ogre slavers. Crushed trees, broken statues, and foul-smelling campfires mark their occupation. Slaves are held in vine-wrapped pits and ruined tree homes.

**🧟 ENCOUNTER 1: Scouting Perimeter (XP: 120)
Location**: Approaching the glade through dense woods and ruined elf statues

**Enemies**:

* 2 Ogre Guards (Standard Ogre stat block)

* 1 Goblin Lookout (uses Goblin Warrior stat block; positioned in a tree)

**Tactics**: The goblin will attempt to flee and alert the main camp. The ogres fight to the death but are dumb and easily distracted.

**Terrain Feature**: Difficult terrain, tangled roots and brambles

**🔥 TRAP 1: “Whiplash Warning” (XP: 40)
Location**: Just inside the glade’s boundary

**Trap Type**: Mechanical

**Effect**: A crude tripwire made of sinew triggers spiked branches to sweep down (Reflex DC 19 or 2d8 slashing).

**Secondary Effect**: Loud bells made of scavenged elf armor alert camp

**Disable**: Thievery DC 17 to spot, DC 19 to disable

**🏚️ ENCOUNTER 2: Slave Pit Camp (XP: 200)
Location**: Center of the glade

**Enemies**:

* 1 Ogre Overseer (custom ogre w/ reach weapon and cruel tactics)

* 2 Ogre Guards

* 1 Hobgoblin Taskmaster (martial-oriented, whip + chain net)

* 1 Elf Druid Slave (bound but may assist if freed early)

**Tactics**: The ogres use slaves as shields or threaten to kill them. Taskmaster uses nets to immobilize PCs.

**Slaves Present**:

* 3 Elves (noncombatants)

* 2 Goblins (scared, may turn if persuaded)

* 1 Kobold (inventor type; may help if freed)

**🔥 TRAP 2: Pit of Shame (XP: 60)
Location**: Between the slave pens and main camp

**Trap Type**: Hidden Pit (10 ft deep, 2d6 fall, spikes for 1d6 bleed)

**Detection**: Perception DC 18

**Disable**: Thievery DC 18

**⚔️ ENCOUNTER 3: The Slaver Boss (XP: 300)
Location**: Atop a ruined elven watchtree, now a crude throne

**Enemies**:

* **Brumgarr the Twin-Tusk** – Ogre Warchief (Advanced Ogre, +10 HP, Greatclub, Intimidate +13)

* 2 Ogre Brutes (rage on first hit)

* 1 Kobold Alchemist (slave "advisor" with bombs; coerced into loyalty)

**Tactics**:

* Brumgarr throws boulders from the tree platform before descending to crush

* The kobold may flee or defect if intimidated/persuaded

**Environmental Feature**: The watchtree is unstable—attacking supports may collapse it

**🌱 ENCOUNTER 4: The Heart Tree (Optional Encounter / Reward)
Location**: Sacred tree desecrated by ogres

**Effect**: A fey guardian (e.g., a wounded **leshy spirit**) pleads for help in healing the tree

**Skill Challenge** (XP: 60):

* Nature DC 19 to cleanse

* Religion DC 17 to appease spirits

* Diplomacy DC 18 to rally slaves to help

**Reward**: If successful, grants **Blessing of the Glade** (10 temporary HP, +1 to saves for 24 hrs)

**🎁 TREASURE**

* **Ironwood Totem** (minor magical item): Can cast *entangle* 1/day

* **Brumgarr's Belt**: +1 potency rune, sized for Medium creatures

* Satchel of mixed coin and art objects (~100 gp in value)

* Hidden stash: Under pit in slave pens (Perception DC 20), contains **healing potions, scroll of restoration, and a moon-touched dagger**

**🗝️ TOTAL XP: ~780 (scalable)**
This provides enough for a full session of adventuring and gives a well-rounded set of challenges (combat, traps, social choices, and exploration).

Would you like tactical maps or stat blocks for any specific enemies?

For a Pathfinder 2E or similar TTRPG setting, an **ogre slaver party** occupying an **elven glade** and maintaining **multiple types of slaves (elves, goblins, kobolds)** would likely be a moderately sized warband, depending on their purpose (raiding, occupying, guarding). Here’s a breakdown of reasonable numbers and structure:

**Typical Ogre Slaver Party (Mid-Level Threat)
Total Ogres**: **8–12**

**Party Breakdown:**

* **1 Ogre Leader** – Possibly a named brute or ettin with better gear, some strategy, and leadership capability.

* **1–2 Ogre Overseers** – Slightly tougher ogres with whips, spiked chains, or cruel tactics.

* **4–6 Ogre Guards** – Standard ogres on patrol, guarding perimeters and the slave pens.

* **2–3 Ogre Brutes/Enforcers** – Used to punish or intimidate slaves. Might be drunk, cruel, or restless.

**Support & Slaves**

* **Elven Slaves**: 6–10 (could include non-combatants, druids, scouts)

* **Goblins**: 4–8 (pressed into service as menial laborers or trap-clearers)

* **Kobolds**: 3–6 (kept for tinkering, traps, or sheer cruelty)
Optional:

* **Beast Pets or Guard Creatures**: 1–2 (e.g., ogre hounds, dire wolves)

* **Slave Warden**: A hobgoblin, bugbear, or low-ranking spellcaster working under the ogres.

**Scaling Suggestions:**

* **Low Threat Version (for L3-4 PCs)**: 5–6 ogres max, one overseer, mostly goblins/kobolds as muscle.

* **High Threat Version (L7+ PCs)**: 12+ ogres, an ettin or troll lieutenant, siege weapons, slave pens, and layered defenses.

Would you like me to design this location with encounter breakdowns or traps next?

Excellent! That opens a whole new layer of intrigue. Here’s how to integrate the **Dandasuka rakshasa** spy into the scenario:

**😈 Hidden Threat: The Dandasuka Spy
📛 Name: Chirrik the Pale**

* **Race**: Dandasuka Rakshasa (Pathfinder 2E Bestiary 2)

* **Disguise**: A wiry, albino kobold scribe with oversized spectacles and a stutter

* **Role**: Spy and agent of the **Rakshasa Maharaja**, the true architect behind the ogre slaver operations

* **Current Position**: Embedded among the slave kobolds; posing as a harmless record-keeper and translator

**🎭 Disguise & Behavior**

* Chirrik is polite, pitiful, and avoids eye contact.

* He appears to be a “non-useful” kobold left to keep the slave records and ledger books.

* He wears a silver monocle carved with obscure runes (actually a **focus for his** ***read aura*** **and** ***message*** **spells**).

**Quote** (in kobold dialect):

*“Me? Oh—oh no, Chirrik just tally little claw. Not brave. Not strong. Only counts things. Please no hit.”*

**🧠 Objectives**

* Report back to the **Maharaja** about resistance movements and weaknesses in the ogre camp

* Discover any fey artifacts hidden in the glade—especially those bound to planar travel or elven magic

* Eliminate or *mark* any potential elven leaders who might escape and rally allies

**🕵️ Detection**

* **Secret Perception DC 24** to notice subtle inconsistencies (e.g., his stutter vanishes in infernal)

* **Religion or Occultism DC 21** to sense his aura is evil despite the humble disguise

* **Zone of Truth or Charm** effects fail (as per Rakshasa traits); only **true seeing** or **detect alignment** will work reliably

**⚔️ Combat Behavior**
If exposed or attacked:

* Immediately casts *invisibility* or *mirror image*, then *dimension door* out

* If cornered, uses **claw attacks** (1d10+ damage) and **rakshasa curse**May try to **possess** or dominate a weak-willed kobold to continue hiding

**🪜 Escape Route**
Chirrik has rigged a **kobold tunnel** leading out of the glade (Survival DC 18 to track), leading to a carved obsidian idol hidden in the forest. The idol is a **scrying anchor** linked to the Maharaja’s palace in a distant jungle.

**🧩 Adventure Hook Expansion**
If the PCs uncover Chirrik:

* They gain a letter in Infernal, magically sealed, containing troop movements, spell rituals, and a coded signature: “*—from the inked claw of Kadratha, Maharaja of the Western Silk*.”

* The Maharaja is building a **multiracial slave empire**—and this ogre camp is just one node in a vast network.

**🏆 Optional Boon**
If Chirrik is captured *alive* and interrogated with appropriate magic or leverage, the PCs may learn:

* A future raid is planned on **a dryad enclave in the next glade**A secret portal is hidden beneath the Heart Tree, once used by the eladrin to travel across planes

* The Maharaja believes an ancient **elven relic**—the *Verdant Sigil*—is buried nearby, which can warp nature and fey boundaries

Want to build out **Kadratha, the Maharaja** next? Or design Chirrik's obsidian idol and escape tunnel as a mini-dungeon?
