# Summer Smash


Entrance
Massive DragonTaur

Dragon head, with an equine body. 2xlarge, as it is really 2 dragons in a costume with a hat. There are prospects, nicknamed the wild things.

Prospect **Wildbriar**
An **forest dragon** who is deeply connected to the geological aspects of Lamannia, particularly its mountains and caves. Flinttail spends much of their time studying the primal energies that flow through the rocks and soil of the plane, often theorizing about how the natural forces of Lamannia can be harnessed to create new forms of magic. They have a personal goal to map out some of the uncharted mountain ranges within Lamannia‚Äôs wild terrain.
Year: Drake

Prospect 5. **Wildpyre**
A **red dragon** who is fascinated by the volcanic regions of Lamannia. Wildpyre feels a deep connection to the wildfires and volcanic eruptions that occur naturally on the plane, believing them to be an essential part of nature's destructive and regenerative cycle. Wildpyre is known for their enthusiasm in teaching others how nature recovers from devastation and believes that fire is a crucial element in maintaining the balance of life and death.
Year: Drake
