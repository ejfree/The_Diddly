Prophecy

*‚ÄúWhen the web is spun across the sky
And the five flames begin to flicker,
Beware the song sung deep below‚Äî
For it seeks to shake the chains of the Queen Below the World.‚Äù*

*The old enemies shall rise again:
First the Gluttons of Stone,
Then the Frozen Brood,
Then the Lords of Ash.*

*Beneath them waits the Threefold Shadow‚Äî
Hunger, Madness, and Blade.*

*Follow the trail of broken crowns,
For where giants fall,
The weaver‚Äôs fangs grow bolder.‚Äù

But all that is here is this‚Ä¶.*
