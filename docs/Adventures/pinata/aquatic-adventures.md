Absolutely! Here's a flavorful and balanced list of **non-monster, non-combat encounters, hazards, and events** for a **Level 4 party in Eberron**, specifically for an ocean voyage. These are categorized by **harmless**, **moderate**, and **extreme** to help you scale tension, pacing, and resource management.

All entries are designed with **Pathfinder 2e mechanics** in mind, using **Exploration Mode, Skill Challenges, Environmental Hazards**, or **Roleplay Scenarios** rather than direct combat.

## ‚öì Harmless Events (Flavor, Roleplay, Low Stakes)

1. **Bioluminescent Tide**
   - At night, the sea glows in shifting colors as bioluminescent plankton bloom. PCs can make **Nature or Arcana checks (DC 15)** to learn this only happens near underwater manifest zones to Thelanis.

2. **Stormlight Mirage**
   - A fleeting mirage appears on the horizon: an upside-down floating city. An **Occultism or Arcana (DC 16)** check reveals it's a mirage caused by planar interference‚Äîlikely Xoriat or Dal Quor.

3. **Curious Sea Elemental (Minor)**
   - A tiny sea elemental takes interest in the ship, playfully mimicking crew members. Dealing with it requires **Diplomacy or Nature (DC 14)** checks. It leaves after an hour.

4. **Ghost Ship in the Fog (Illusion)**
   - A spooky ghost ship passes in dense fog but vanishes on approach. No danger‚Äîjust eerie. A **Religion or Arcana (DC 15)** check confirms it's a harmless echo from Dolurrh.

5. **Korranberg Message Bottle**
   - PCs find a sealed message in a bottle from the Korranberg Chronicle offering a writing contract for adventurous tales. May spark side quests.

6. **Food Overboard**
   - A barrel of pickled eels bursts and falls into the sea. Sailors panic slightly. Players can assist recovery via **Athletics or Sailing Lore (DC 14)**.

7. **Magical Aurora**
   - The sky glows with multicolored auroras. Casters sense a subtle magic surge. A **Spellcraft or Arcana (DC 13)** reveals the aurora may be a natural link to the plane of Syrania.

8. **Hatching Skysquid Eggs**
   - Tiny, floating skysquid hatch and briefly attach to the ship's rigging. They glow, float, and disappear into the sky. Cute and harmless.

9. **Drunken Crew Games**
   - The crew gets a bit too celebratory and starts a betting game. PCs can join in for coin and roleplay. Use **Performance, Deception, or Diplomacy (DC 14)**.

10. **Lost Pet Parrot**
   - A parrot from another ship lands on deck, shouting strange commands in Goblin. Can be befriended with **Nature or Animal Empathy (DC 13)**.

## üåä Moderate Hazards (Skill Challenges, Delays, Minor Spell/Item Use)

1. **Rogue Wave**
   - A sudden surge smashes across the deck. **Reflex Save (DC 18)** or be knocked prone and potentially lose unsecured gear. Crafting or Survival checks help secure the ship post-wave.

2. **Mana-Slick Waters**
   - The ship sails through a strange slick left by a spellcasting sea creature. **Arcana (DC 17)** reveals it may disrupt magical navigation (penalty to arcane rituals unless counteracted).

3. **Sargasso Entanglement**
   - Thick seaweed grips the ship. 3-round skill challenge: PCs must use **Athletics, Nature, or Acrobatics (DC 18)** to cut or burn free before the tide shifts.

4. **Psychic Whispers from the Deep**
   - The party hears faint, haunting whispers. **Will Save (DC 19)** or suffer mild confusion (flat check 5+ to focus for 1 hour). Source unknown‚Äîties to Dal Quor or Xoriat.

5. **Malfunctioning Bound Elemental**
   - The ship's elemental engine sputters. Use **Crafting or Arcana (DC 19)** to stabilize it. Failure reduces speed or causes one-time damage (2d6).

6. **Navigational Confusion**
   - A minor planar rift shifts magnetic orientation. PCs must realign charts using **Survival or Sailing Lore (DC 17)**. Failure causes a 1-day delay.

7. **Ancient Draconic Rune Buoy**
   - The ship nears a floating obsidian rune buoy. Arcane magic surges. Interacting requires **Arcana, Occultism, or Religion (DC 20)**. Harmless if studied; dangerous if tampered.

## üå™Ô∏è Extreme Events (Resource Drain, RP Fallout, Dangerous Hazard)

1. **Manifest Zone Shift**
   - The ship crosses into a shifting manifest zone connected to **Risia (Plane of Ice)** or **Kythri (Chaos)**. Sudden weather or gravity changes. **Endurance, Reflex Saves, or Arcana (DC 21‚Äì23)** to avoid damage or disorientation. Can last 1‚Äì3 hours.

2. **Temporal Distortion**
   - Time flows strangely for a day. PCs may age slightly or find the voyage skips forward or backward. **Will Save (DC 22)** or be out of sync for the day (penalty to initiative and reactions).

3. **Planar Fog (Dal Quor Bleedthrough)**
   - A dense, sleep-inducing fog envelops the ship. PCs must pass **Fortitude Saves (DC 22)** each hour or suffer fatigue or fall into magical slumber. Dreamlike visions may reveal secrets or prophetic images.

4. **Living Shipwood**
   - A section of the ship‚Äôs hull reanimates from a long-dead Dryad tree. PCs must **calm or subdue it (Nature or Diplomacy, DC 24)** or risk it damaging the vessel from within.

5. **Cursed Cargo**
   - A crate of contraband recovered earlier contains a dormant curse tied to the Shadow Marches. Once opened, it infects the crew with a compulsion or mild madness. **Counteract check (DC 23)** to cleanse it.
