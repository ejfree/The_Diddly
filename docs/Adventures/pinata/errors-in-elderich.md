# Errors in Elderich

### **Encounter: Infernal Negotiations Gone Wrong**

#### **Setting:**
Professor Charis Emberfiend has taken her Elderich Engineering 199 class on an experimental field trip to the **Plane of Fire**, where they are testing a new method of **hellfire energy siphoning**. The method involves pulling energy from existing **infernal ley lines** and redirecting it into specialized power cores. However, the siphoning appears to have **aggravated a group of demons**, who claim that the professor **stole** something from their master, a **Greater Demon named Vorgo’thak the Charred Maw**.

In truth, Vorgo’thak is an **arrogant and easily outmaneuvered** demon, and the professor simply **tricked him into losing** a wager over an unusual artifact: **The Gullet of the Devourer**, a **chitinous, ever-burning furnace-like skull** rumored to belong to a long-dead demon lord. Charis obtained it through legally binding infernal contracts (which Vorgo’thak foolishly signed). Now, the demons have come to take it back by force.

## **Encounter 1: Infernal Shock Troops (Warm-Up Battle)**

**Creatures:**

- **2x Babau (CR 3)**

- **4x Emberclaw Quasits (CR 1)**

**Tactics:**

- The Babaus use **Invisibility** to ambush the party, prioritizing spellcasters and ranged attackers.

- The Emberclaw Quasits (a fiery variant of normal quasits) harass with **fear effects** and **burning claws**, setting up distractions for the Babaus.

- If one Babau falls, the remaining demons **try to grab the artifact** rather than continue the fight.

**Battlefield Elements:**

- **Burning Lava Veins:** Any movement off the main platform can lead to lava hazard (Basic Reflex DC 18 for half damage, 3d6 fire).

- **Fluctuating Energy Fields:** The experiment causes periodic surges, requiring a DC 17 Reflex save or **suffer an arcane backlash (1d6 force damage and pushed 5 feet).**

---

## **Encounter 2: The Furious Champion of Vorgo’thak**
When the initial wave fails, **Vorgo’thak’s enforcer, a massive rage-fueled fire demon, arrives personally** to take the artifact by force.

**Creatures:**

- **1x The Charred Maw’s Bloodletter (CR 5 Unique Demon)**

- **2x Fiendish Magma Elementals (CR 3, modified)**

### **The Charred Maw’s Bloodletter (Unique Demon, CR 5)**
A massive **balor-blooded enforcer**, this fiend wields a massive molten chain that it lashes around violently. It is **burning with rage and humiliation**, eager to reclaim the artifact and redeem Vorgo’thak.

**Abilities:**

- **Molten Chain Strike:** 2d8+5 fire damage, grabs on crit.

- **Infernal Heat:** Any creature within 10 feet takes **persistent 1d6 fire damage** if they start their turn there.

- **Furious Charge:** Can stride twice and make a free attack.

**Tactics:**

- The Bloodletter tries to **disarm and take the artifact** before fully engaging in combat.

- The Magma Elementals create **hazardous terrain** and block escape routes.

- If the Bloodletter drops below **30 HP, it tries to bargain**, suggesting a deal where the party can "borrow" the artifact, but must eventually return it to hell.

---

## **Resolution:**
If the party **defeats** the Bloodletter and its minions, **Professor Charis Emberfiend laughs and mocks Vorgo’thak’s poor choice in minions**. She uses the artifact’s energy to **banish any survivors** before casually **resuming her lecture as if nothing happened.**

If the party **negotiates**, they might be able to **keep the artifact** by making another **contractually binding agreement**, once again **tricking Vorgo’thak.**

---

### **Loot & Rewards:**

- **Infernal Engineering Notes:** A set of schematics on siphoning hellfire energy (worth 50 gp).

- **The Gullet of the Devourer (Artifact-Level MacGuffin).** If they keep it, it might draw more demons in the future.

- **Demonic Scorchbrand (Consumable):** A one-time rune that adds **1d4 fire damage** to a weapon for a day.

### **Professor Charis’s Final Words:**
"See, class? This is what happens when you don’t read the fine print. Now, back to **calculating infernal thermal efficiency.**"

In Elderich Fundamentals - Elderich Engineering 199, An overview of the fundamentals of elderich magics and the basic integration of eldritch magic with engineering principles. It is taught by **Professor Charis Emberfiend (Infernal Dragon):** Specializes in the integration of fire magic with engineering, focusing on energy efficiency and power generation. Her lectures are fiery and filled with real-world applications.

Create an encounter where as part of her small class experiment on the plane of fire, demons led by a Greater Demon appear to reclaim something that the professor “stole”. In reality the professor simply outmaneuvered the demon who was pretty stupid. However, whatever they are arguing over should be unusual.

There should be 2 monster encounters, demonic in nature, for 4 PF2E characters of 4th level. The demons are attempting to recover the item in question which is being guarded by the party.
