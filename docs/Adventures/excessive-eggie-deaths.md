# Excessive Eggie Deaths

Basically

Something about a wing from this year appears to be important to the prophecy. Multiple deaths so far. Have each person roll a d100. That wing

This is also what is causing all the sick days in the eggie wings. Write any abscesses into the plot.

This is biological warfare from the BBEG (whoever that is)

Background Reasonâ€¦. They are going feral through the portal trips? Or because other reasons. Maybe the enemy has a way to do this when they are away from argonessen and young.
