**Name**: Fetidclaw Mirestalker (“Ulthar”)
**Dragon Type**: Black
**Year**: 1022 (records only; she does not remember)
**Major**: Dragon History (records)
**Dorm**: Nexus (records)

### Personality

Ulthar’s mind is shattered by Xoriat. She has no memory of her past, no recognition of allies, and no goals beyond violence. She paces in jagged arcs, mutters over overlapping thoughts, and interprets all speech as hostile intent. Her default is to kill everyone in sight.

Behavioral cues:
- Fixations: “the chorus behind thought,” counting in prime rhythms
- Triggers: mirrors, direct eye contact, chanting, open sky
- Signals: claw-taps in uneven patterns, sudden stillness before a lunge

### Description

A lean, acid-scarred black dragon with algae-slick scales and a stagnant mire reek. Horns are pitted and asymmetrical; pupils gleam with faint violet iridescence that never quite centers. In humanoid guise, her gaze slides off reflections and her voice carries a doubled echo.

### Encounter Role (Level 6 party)

Boss-caliber threat tied to the Eldrich Temple’s Xoriat convergence. Ulthar does not negotiate and seeks total annihilation of nearby creatures. Place her as the apex encounter after significant attrition, or as the temple’s roaming catastrophe that the party can avoid with planning.

Difficulty guidance:
- Base: use a Young Black Dragon statblock adjusted to Level 6 (PF2e “Weak” adjustment), or an equivalent CR for your system.
- Add the Xoriat-Madness traits below to align with the temple’s theme.

### Xoriat-Madness (Template Notes)

- Resist mental 5; immune to confused from allies’ effects
- Aura — Fractured Chorus (10 ft): first time a creature enters or starts its turn in the aura each round, it must succeed at a DC 23 Will save or become confused 1 (or stupefied 1 for 1 minute on a success at your table’s preference). A creature that critically succeeds is temporarily immune for 24 hours.
- Surge of Gibbering (Reaction, once/round): When Ulthar is critically hit, release a 10‑ft burst of psychic static (2d8 mental, basic Will DC 23).
- Once/day: confusion (self-centered eruption flavored as the chorus overwhelming reality).

Tuning knobs:
- If party control is strong, raise DCs to 24 and increase aura radius to 15 ft.
- If party lacks area control or protection from mental effects, drop the aura to “start of turn only.”

### Tactics

- Opener: Acid Breath to force movement into hazardous zones; follows with wing or tail to corral.
- Leverage: Stays near eldershard pylons or distortion fields (see temple notes) to stack mental damage/conditions.
- Targeting: Prioritizes casters with silence/mental protection, then those who separate from the group.
- Retreat: None. Ulthar fights to the death unless physically displaced or counter-sealed.

### Hooks & Integration

- Roaming Catastrophe: The party hears clashing echoes and acid-gouged stone ahead; choosing the long route may avoid her entirely.
- Shard Lure: When the Mind Core pulses, Ulthar converges on its location within 1–2 minutes, interrupting other combats or rituals.
- Environmental Synergy: Within 20 ft of an eldershard pylon, failed mental saves against her aura impose stupefied 2 instead of 1.

### GM Notes (Secrets)

- Ulthar does not know her past and cannot be reasoned with.
- Lolth’s deeper plan: exploit Xoriat to drive draconic minds insane and collapse draconic power structures. This plot is unknown to anyone in the temple (including Ulthar and Aruthane).
- Foreshadow softly via spider‑silk motifs worked into cult fetishes or a single eight‑pointed fracture pattern—never named.

### Treasure (on defeat)

- Eldershard Sliver (occult focus; once/day cast fear or paranoia at 3rd level)
- Acid‑pitted signet from Nexus archives (identifies her student record if researched)
- 50 gp in corroded bindings, ritual chalks, and warped lenses

### Using an Existing Statblock

- Pathfinder 2e: Young Black Dragon (Level 7); apply Weak adjustment to level 6; add Xoriat‑Madness template above.
- 5e: Young Black Dragon; add Aura (10 ft, DC = 8 + prof + CHA) causing one round of confusion on a failed Wisdom save once per turn; resistance to psychic; once/day confusion.

### Development Options

- If spared or captured: Ulthar remains violently incoherent; removing the chorus requires a bespoke ritual (3 stages: dampen, isolate, harmonize) that risks a catastrophic feedback if failed.
- If slain near the Mind Core: A backlash wave imposes frightened 1 (or short-term madness in 5e) on survivors as her thoughts shred into the shard.
