# Solstice of the Horde-Trees (Dragon University Holiday Encounter)

A winter-solstice tradition at Dragon University that—if you ask the baby dragons—symbolizes one sacred principle:

**Break things to get prizes.**

The **Horde-Trees** (called **Hoard-Trees** by faculty trying to sound dignified) are semi-living Lamannian automaton/elemental trees hung with jingling ornaments. Hatchlings are encouraged to chase them, slam them, and knock ornaments off. Each ornament is redeemable for a **real prize**.

This year, the grand prize tree wakes up mean and starts defending “its” loot with elementals.

## What This Is

- **Location**: The Commons (Water Quad), spilling into the **Grand Diddly Amphitheater**
- **Length**: 30–60 minutes
- **Core fantasy**: daycare chaos + fundraiser carnival + elemental outbreak
- **Win condition**: keep hatchlings safe, keep prizes flowing, and stop the grand prize Horde-Tree from escalating into a campus disaster

## Quick Hooks (Why The Party Is Here)

Pick one:

- **Hired help**: Safety Marshal Prim paid the party to “keep the solstice crowd safe.”
- **Club favor**: Mirecrown asked the party to attend as “responsible adults” because Horde-Trees get unpredictable around excited hatchlings.
- **Free food, bad timing**: Chef Gristle comped the party’s tickets/snacks; they’re closest when things go sideways.
- **Investigation lead**: the party is tracking a trinket vendor; the fundraiser is their next stop.

### Tone Note

This encounter plays best if the party is encouraged to **wrangle, divert, and de-escalate** rather than razing the venue. The university cares about casualties *and* property damage, and the hatchlings are very, very fragile (emotionally).

## The Holiday (In-World): “Bonk For Blessings”

On the longest night, dragons mark the **Turn of the Great Scale**. The official story is about fortune and growth.

The actual tradition is:

- Io'lokar families drop off hatchlings for the bonk arena while adults socialize and bid at auction.
- Hatchlings chase and body-check the Horde-Trees to knock down ornaments.
- Handlers and older students keep the arena “safe-ish.”
- Everyone eats snacks and cheers like it’s a sporting event.

## The Fundraiser: The Horde-Tree Prize Drive

Run by the **Lamannia Enthusiasts Society** (trees + arena wards) with booths/food support from **The Draconic Gastronomy Guild**.

- **Goal**: raise funds for the **Hearthroot Scholarship** (tuition aid + house repairs + expedition grants).
- **How it works**:
  - Visitors buy **prize tags** (each tag = 1 redemption).
  - Horde-Trees “drop” tagged ornaments when struck (or when the warding decides the kid “earned it”).
  - Staff at redemption booths swap the ornament for a prize (roll on the d100 table).
- **What goes wrong**: the grand prize tree was built around a Lamannian feral-spirit knot. When hundreds of hatchlings start bonking it, the knot decides it’s being hunted… and fights back.

### Fundraiser Stakes (Optional Tracker)

Start at **6 Fundraiser Points**.

- -1 when a hatchling is put in real danger (fire/cider, stampede, falling decor, etc.).
- -1 when a booth is wrecked or a crowd surge gets out of hand.
- +1 when the party completes a mini-game cleanly (below) or saves a major donor/auction lot.

End result:
- **5–7**: the benefit is a success; the party gets a public shout-out and first pick of a “thank you” prize.
- **3–4**: the benefit limps along; rewards are quieter (a favor, not a ceremony).
- **0–2**: the university is embarrassed; the party is still thanked, but someone starts auditing *everyone*.

## Key NPCs (Drop-In)

- **Mirecrown** (Lamannia Enthusiasts Society): protective of the trees *and* the kids; refuses to let anyone “solve this with fire.”
- **Cinderburrow** (Lamannia Enthusiasts Society): event coordinator; already has an evacuation route and a headcount board.
- **Chef Gristle** (Draconic Gastronomy Guild): prioritizes crowd safety; knows where the emergency salt/ice/firebreak supplies are.
- **Safety Marshal Prim** (campus safety): wants containment, not collateral.

## Running The Event: Semi-Feral Baby Dragon Mini-Games

Treat these as quick 1–2 action problems happening during initiative. Each mini-game is a chance to earn **Fundraiser Points**, prevent injuries, or weaken the boss.

PF2e note: set DCs to **standard DC by level** (party level) unless noted.

### Hatchling Roster (13 Toddlers, A–M)

- **Annie** (Amethyst): curious, headbutts shiny things; big echoing coos.
- **Bobby** (Brass): energetic, tail-sweeps snacks; squeals when excited.
- **Chucky** (Copper): prank-loving, loves hiding under benches; huffs tiny sparks.
- **Danny** (Crystal): dreamy, chases light beams; flops when dizzy.
- **Ellie** (Red): possessive, guards any ornament they grab; tiny smoke puffs when upset.
- **Fanny** (White): chilly cuddler, likes piling onto boots; sneeze makes frost flecks.
- **Gary** (Gold): friendly magnet, follows whoever has the brightest clothes.
- **Hickory** (Shadow): shy,  hides behind prize booths; eyes glow in dim corners.
- **Ivy** (Green): clingy climber, will latch onto capes and not let go.
- **Jacky** (Silver): loves bells, shakes anything that rattles; spins in circles.
- **Kirby** (Bronze): herder instinct, tries to round up other babies; buzzy chirps.
- **Lenny** (Forest): rolls in any mulch/hedge; arrives covered in leaves.
- **Moe** (Storm): bouncy, static-crackles when happy; boops noses then sprints.

### Mini-Game 1: “No Biting!”
One hatchling has grabbed another hatchling’s tail-fin/ear-frill and won’t let go.

- **Success**: recover hatchling; gain **+1 Fundraiser Point**
- **Critical Success**: the hatchling “pays you” with a stolen ornament (roll prize)

### Mini-Game 5: “That One Likes You Now”
A hatchling decides you are its favorite person and refuses to leave your shoulder/back.

- **Check**: Acrobatics (keep balance), Athletics (gently remove), Diplomacy (trade attention), or Nature (calming signals)
- **Success**: hand off to a handler; gain **+1 Fundraiser Point**
- **Critical Success**: the hatchling also drops an ornament in your hand (roll prize)
- **Failure**: you’re off-guard until end of your next turn (distracted).

## Enemies: Horde-Tree Ornamentals (Unique Elementals)

The “drops” animate into elementals: ornaments + Lamannian sap + feral hatchling excitement.

## PF2e: Ready-To-Run Stat Blocks (Homebrew)

Use the four small elementals as **Creature PL** (standard) or **PL-1** (easier), applying weak/elite as needed. The boss is one enemy only: the **Hearthbough Warden** as **Creature PL+1**.

These blocks are written at **Creature 2** so they’re easy to weak/elite and easy to re-level if you prefer.

### Boss: The Grand Prize Horde-Tree (Hearthbough Warden)

Run **one enemy only** in the finale: the **Hearthbough Warden** reflavored as the grand prize Horde-Tree.

**Speed** 25 feet, climb 20 feet

**Hoard Growth** At the end of each of the warden’s turns, it “absorbs” unattended coins/ornaments within 20 feet (purely narrative). The first time each combat it “fills,” it gains **15 temporary HP** and its Strikes deal **+2 damage** for 1 round.

**🎯 Melee [one-action]
Bough Slam** +16 (reach 10 ft.)

**Damage** 2d10+7 bludgeoning plus 1d6 spirit (it “collects what you owe”)

**Ornament Hail [two-actions]** (evocation) The warden shakes its canopy, pelting a **15-foot cone**. Creatures in the area take **6d6** bludgeoning (**basic Reflex DC 22**). On a critical failure, the creature is also **knocked prone**.

**Solstice Surges [one-action]** (primal) Choose one (can’t choose the same surge two rounds in a row):

- **Icy Sheen**: a 20-foot burst within 60 feet becomes slick ice until the start of the warden’s next turn (difficult terrain; creatures that enter must succeed at a **DC 20 Acrobatics** check or fall prone).
- **Root Snare**: roots erupt in a 10-foot burst within 60 feet; creatures must attempt a **DC 22 Reflex** save or be **immobilized** until they Escape (**DC 22**).

## Encounter Structure (Waves + Single Boss)

### Scene 1: “Doors Open, Kids Unleashed” (5–10 min)

Read-aloud vibe: Io'lokar parents hand over hatchlings, the announcer shouts rules, and the first Horde-Tree clanks into the arena—branches jingling with prizes. The babies charge. The crowd cheers.

Then the ornaments rattle wrong. A few “drops” sprout legs, wings, and spite.

Immediate problems (pick 2):

- A hatchling is mesmerized by a jingling elemental in the arena.
- A snack stall is getting swarmed (and it’s hot).
- A donation runner is being mugged by ribbons and coins.

**Wave 1**: 2–6 small elementals (mix 2 types).

### Scene 2: “Keep It Fun” (5–10 min)

Run 1–2 mini-games (above). Each success is a visible “the party are heroes” moment.

Optional skill challenge (3 successes before 2 failures; Arcana/Nature/Occultism/Society): stabilize the arena wards.

- **Success**: gain **+1 Fundraiser Point** and the party gets **2 prize tags** to hand out (roll twice).
- **Critical success** (if you’re tracking): the boss starts with **-15 HP** (or loses resistances for its first round).
- **Failure**: **-1 Fundraiser Point** and Wave 2 begins with +1 extra small elemental.

### Scene 3: “The Grand Prize Tree Takes The Field” (10–20 min)

**Wave 2**: 2–4 small elementals (one type you haven’t used yet). Keep it quick.

Then the **grand prize Horde-Tree** stomps into the arena.

**Boss fight**: run **only** the **Hearthbough Warden** (above).

Boss win options:

- **Combat**: defeat the Warden; the wards snap back and the tree “plays dead.”
- **Re-key mid-fight**: once per round, one PC can spend **[two-actions]** to attempt Arcana/Nature/Occultism (standard DC by level). On success, reduce the Warden’s HP by **10** (or remove its resistances for 1 round).
- **Crowd advantage**: if Fundraiser Points are **5+**, handlers keep hatchlings out of the arena; PCs gain a +1 circumstance bonus to Re-key checks.

### Prize Drops During Combat

Prizes are the whole point. Make them visible and immediate.

- When a small elemental is defeated, it drops 1 ornament at the arena edge.
- When the boss takes a critical hit (or drops below half HP), it drops 1 ornament.
- A PC can use **Interact** to scoop an ornament and toss it to a handler to roll on the Prize Table.

## Twist (Optional, for a Follow-Up)

The grand prize tree wasn’t an accident—someone seeded the arena with **“Greed-Grade Planar Glitter”** to make ornaments “want” to be collected (and hatchlings “want” to bonk harder).

Suspects:

- Rival club prank
- A black-market vendor from **Planar Market Exchange**
- A stressed bursar who wanted the scholarship fund to “work harder”

## Rewards (Make It Feel Like a Fundraiser, Not a Dungeon)

- **Hearthroot Scholarship Favor**: the university owes the party a favor (priority access, housing help, a professor introduction, a library pull).
- **Public recognition**: the party gets a commemorative ornament (tiny magic trinket; +1 circumstance bonus once during the next campus social scene).
- **Gastronomy voucher**: Chef Gristle issues a “one free meal per PC” chit redeemable at a Guild event (or a treat now).
