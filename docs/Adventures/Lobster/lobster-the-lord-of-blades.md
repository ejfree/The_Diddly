# Lobster - The Lord of Blades

This whole robot culture is lead by “Lobster” AKA the Lord of Blades, who is a CR20 monster. This is the BBEG. He controls the Mournland. Metal beings have immunity to the positive and negative energies, so his band of authoritarian murder bots are immune to the mist. This will be new news to everyone.
