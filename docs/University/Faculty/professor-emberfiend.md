### Emberfiend

Ancient Infernal Dragon

### Role

Professor of **Eldritch Engineering**

**College**: Academy of Archano-Elemental and Techno Mechanics

**Major**: Eldritch Engineering

### Personality

Emberfiend is incisive, exacting, and relentlessly pragmatic. She prizes results over ritual and treats problems like contracts to be deconstructed into binding clauses. While her humor runs dry and razor-thin, she is fiercely protective of diligent students and ruthless toward predatory powers that exploit invention.

### Description

A furnace-heart glow pulses beneath soot-dark scales etched with smoldering rune-sutures. Twin onyx horns sweep back like quillons, and iron filigree braces her wings with latticework sigils that flare when she speaks. Cinderlight halos her eyes, and the scent of hot metal and parchment ash lingers in her wake.

### Background

Once retained as a master artificer in an infernal patentarium, Emberfiend drafted engines that monetized oaths and mechanized obedience. She defected after sabotaging a vault that fed on apprentices’ aspirations, fleeing with blueprints she now repurposes to liberate rather than bind. At the academy, she runs amnesty programs for inventors trapped by cursed non‑competes.

### Classes Taught

- **ELEN 199 – Eldritch Fundamentals**



### Academic Approach

- **Course Focus**: Reverse-engineering hostile artifacts, contract-warded machinery, and pact-powered systems to expose leverage points and redesign them for ethical use.
- **Teaching Style**: Studio labs with timed breakdowns, red-team audits of student designs, and viva-style defenses where every sigil must justify its cost.
- **Philosophy**: Innovation is responsibility; power that cannot be explained or reclaimed is power unfit to wield.

### Faith and Combat Prowess

- **Faith Alignment**: Adherent of the Ember Ledger, an order devoted to voiding unjust compacts and emancipating bound creators.
- **Combat Style**: Counter-binding and feedback redirection—she snares spellforms with chain-wards and converts their energy into protective buffers.
- **Signature Move**: Hellchain Reversal—barbed runes lash a hostile effect, annul its clause, then rebound its force as a ward over allies.

### Classroom & Teaching Environment

The Crucible Annex hums like a well-tuned engine. Brass gantries carry locked artefacts overhead, and each bench is ringed by audit-sigils that log every surge and inscription. Students clock in with a counter-hex and clock out by explaining one improvement to a peer’s design.

### Quotes

- "If a device hides its cost, it is already stealing."
- "Take it apart until it tells you the truth."
- "A vow is just a machine made of words."

### Encounter Ideas

- Recover a stolen regulator core before a cartel fits it to a soul-harvesting loom.
- Field-test a failsafe that dissolves coercive bonds during a devil-backed auction.
- Protect amnesty applicants as Emberfiend negotiates the voiding of their cursed patents.
