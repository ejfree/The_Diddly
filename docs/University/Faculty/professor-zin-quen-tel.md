### Zin Quen’tel

Ancient Amethyst Dragon

### Role

Professor of **Economic Dominance and Resource Management**

**College**: School of Yield Surging

**Major**: Economic Dominance and Resource Management

### Personality

Patient, data-obsessed, and drily funny. Zin Quen’tel sees economies as living spells and delights in teaching students to read their pulses.

### Description

Deep amethyst scales with fine lattice veining; abacus beads click along a tail chain when she thinks. Her eyes mirror candlestick charts in violet.

### Background

Former analyst for a central thaumic bank, she designed buffers that prevented a ritual run from erasing savings. She now teaches counter-cyclic policy and transparent magic.

### Classes Taught

- **EDRM 245 – Inflation Magic and Monetary Rituals**



### Academic Approach

- **Course Focus**: Inflation rituals, monetary anchors, and spell-backed currency governance.
- **Teaching Style**: Lab economy simulations, open ledgers, and postmortems on failed policies.
- **Philosophy**: Print trust, not just money.

### Faith and Combat Prowess

- **Faith Alignment**: Prism of Equilibrium—balances plenty against prudence.
- **Combat Style**: Resonant dampers that null panic and price-gouge hexes.
- **Signature Move**: Anchor Rate—sets a stabilizing cadence that weakens frenzy magic and bolsters logistics spells.

### Classroom & Teaching Environment

Tiered seminar with a live ‘microeconomy’ sandbox where students set and adjust variables in real time.

### Quotes

- "Policies are spells—state your costs aloud."
- "Stability is a kindness with compound interest."
- "Measure twice; intervene once."

### Encounter Ideas

- Halt a spiraling barter curse by re-pegging the market.
- Audit a city mint whose wards leak value overnight.
- Design a relief scrip that resists counterfeiting by hungry wizards.
