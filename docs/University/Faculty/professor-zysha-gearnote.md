### Zysha Gearnote

Ancient Gold Dragon

### Role

Professor of **Arcane Artifice and Enchantment Studies**

**College**: School of Yield Surging

**Major**: Arcane Artifice and Enchantment Studies

### Personality

Cheerfully exacting and evangelical about good process. Zysha believes craftsmanship scales only when humility and QA scale with it.

### Description

Bright gold scales with rivulet-like seams; a bandolier of calipers and empathy runes crosses her chest. Her laugh sounds like a clean bell.

### Background

Former chief of a wartime manufactory that pivoted to prosthetics, she designed audit trails that saved lives. She now teaches factories to make blessings, not accidents.

### Classes Taught

- **AAES 246 – Mass Production of Magical Items**



### Academic Approach

- **Course Focus**: Scalable enchantment pipelines, safety interlocks, and ethical sourcing of reagents.
- **Teaching Style**: Kanban for magic; students run sprints, unit-test charms, and file incident reports.
- **Philosophy**: Every item is a promise to a stranger.

### Faith and Combat Prowess

- **Faith Alignment**: Guild of the Golden Hand—service through serviceable tools.
- **Combat Style**: Radiant wards that turn shrapnel to light and redirect force into the ground.
- **Signature Move**: Quality Stamp—imprints a seal that suppresses malfunction and amplifies benevolent effects.

### Classroom & Teaching Environment

An assembly floor with flow boards, enchantment jigs, and a transparent ‘defect wall’ where mistakes are displayed and learned from.

### Quotes

- "We don’t make things; we make trust."
- "Scale the care, not just the output."
- "If you can’t test it, don’t ship it."

### Encounter Ideas

- Audit a shady supplier whose reagents ‘forget’ their provenance.
- Stand up an emergency line to produce ward-bracelets for evacuees.
- Quell a sabotage cascade by tracing a single mislabeled rune.
