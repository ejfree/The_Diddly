### Dean Arcanix

Ancient Occult Dragon

### Role

Dean of **Magical Theory and Application**

**College**: Quintessence Institute

**Major**: Magical Theory and Application

### Personality

Arcanix is a creature of enigma and intellect. He is known for his calm, composed demeanor, often appearing as the most tranquil presence in the room. However, beneath his serene exterior lies a fiercely passionate heart, devoted to uncovering the deepest magical truths. His approach to teaching is one of encouragement towards questioning known boundaries and exploring the realms beyond.

### Description

Arcanix has matte grey & beige scales. His eyes are deep violet, reflecting a lifetime of studying arcane lore. His wings, large and majestic, are etched with silvery runes that glow faintly when he is channeling magical energies.

### Background

Descended from a venerable line of occult dragons, Arcanix’s ancestry has always been deeply intertwined with the mystical and the mysterious. From a young age, he showed an exceptional affinity for understanding and manipulating the esoteric forces of the world. This led him to a lifelong pursuit of knowledge, particularly the kind that lies forgotten or hidden.

### Classes Taught

- **MATH 340 – Meta-Thaumic Proofs and Paradox**



### Academic Approach

- **Course Focus**: Arcanix leads dragons through rigorous study of spell structure, planar correspondences, and the safe deconstruction of volatile rituals.
- **Teaching Style**: He teaches by demonstration, sketching glowing runes in the air while inviting students to replicate each sigil under his patient guidance, then assigning meditative reflection to internalize the lesson.
- **Philosophy**: “No secret is worth the cost of losing yourself”—he insists that true mastery comes from balancing curiosity with responsibility.

### Faith and Combat Prowess

- **Faith Alignment**: Keeper of the Veiled Library, a mystery cult devoted to safeguarding knowledge too dangerous for the unprepared.
- **Combat Style**: Prefers counter-magic and redirective wards, unraveling enemy spells and turning raw arcana into binding threads.
- **Signature Move**: *Null Sigil Mandala*—Arcanix weaves a spinning circle of sigils that absorbs a hostile spell, then detonates as a pulse of silencing energy.

### Classroom & Teaching Environment

His lecture hall, the Obscura Annex, is a windowless amphitheater carved from obsidian. Runes glow along the walls in response to spoken equations, and the ceiling mirrors whichever plane the class is studying. Students sit at tiered desks equipped with attunement crystals that record their personal resonance for later review.

### Quotes

- “Curiosity without discipline is how worlds unravel.”
- “If you cannot explain a spell to a novice, you have no business casting it.”
- “Erase fear, not caution—the former hinders discovery, the latter preserves it.”

### Encounter Ideas

- Arcanix asks the party to escort him into the catacombs beneath the Annex to recover a stolen grimoire before its wards expire.
- A miscast student ritual tears open a portal; Arcanix needs capable adventurers to stabilize the breach while he performs the sealing liturgy.
- The Veiled Library demands proof of Arcanix’s stewardship—he tasks the heroes with retrieving a lost codex from the Plane of Shadows to satisfy the order.
