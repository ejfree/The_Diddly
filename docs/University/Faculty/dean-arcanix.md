**Appearance**: Arcanix has matte grey & beige scales. His eyes are deep violet, reflecting a lifetime of studying arcane lore. His wings, large and majestic, are etched with silvery runes that glow faintly when he is channeling magical energies. Draw it.

**Background**: Descended from a venerable line of occult dragons, Arcanix’s ancestry has always been deeply intertwined with the mystical and the mysterious. From a young age, he showed an exceptional affinity for understanding and manipulating the esoteric forces of the world. This led him to a lifelong pursuit of knowledge, particularly the kind that lies forgotten or hidden.

**Personality**: Arcanix is a creature of enigma and intellect. He is known for his calm, composed demeanor, often appearing as the most tranquil presence in the room. However, beneath his serene exterior lies a fiercely passionate heart, devoted to uncovering the deepest magical truths. His approach to teaching is one of encouragement towards questioning known boundaries and exploring the realms beyond.

**Abilities**: As an expert in magical theory and application, Arcanix possesses the ability to manipulate the very fabric of reality on a subtle level.

He can interact with and manipulate esoteric objects, drawing out their hidden powers or resealing them if necessary.

**Role at University**: As the Dean, Arcanix is responsible for overseeing the academic development of the institute's curriculum and ensuring that the teaching aligns with the mystical traditions of their forebears. He also mentors students, guiding them not just in their studies but in the responsible use of their growing powers.

**Current Quest**: Arcanix is currently deciphering an ancient grimoire that was recently unearthed in the ruins beneath the university. This tome is believed to contain spells lost to time and the secret to a legendary power that could alter the understanding of magic itself.

Arcanix brings a deep, enriching presence to the Dragon University, inspiring both awe and scholarly pursuit among students and faculty alike.
