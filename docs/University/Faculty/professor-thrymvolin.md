### Professor Thrymvolin

Ancient Amethyst Dragon

### Role

Professor of **Arcanomechanics**

**College**: Academy of Archano-Elemental and Techno Mechanics

**Major**: Arcanomechanics

### Personality

Thrymvolin is methodical and precise, often lost in thought or tinkering with intricate devices. They have a calm demeanor but exhibit intense focus and enthusiasm when discussing their field of expertise. Their approach to teaching is highly analytical, encouraging students to understand the underlying principles of arcanomechanics through hands-on experimentation and rigorous theoretical exploration.

### Description

Professor Thrymvolin, with their gleaming amethyst scales and piercing crystalline eyes, embodies the innovative spirit of arcanomechanics. As a researcher and educator, Thrymvolin is deeply engaged in the synthesis of magical energies and mechanical principles, creating devices that not only manipulate but also enhance elemental forces. Their lab is filled with buzzing contraptions and glowing arcane instruments, serving as a testament to their commitment to pushing the boundaries of magical technology. Known for their meticulous nature and profound theoretical knowledge, Thrymvolin is a revered figure among students and colleagues, always eager to share insights into the complex interplay of magic and mechanics.

### Background

Thrymvolin was once chief systems architect for the Crystal Bastion, a floating archive that catalogued magical patents. When the Bastion fell to sabotage, they dedicated themselves to open-source arcanomechanics, believing innovation should be shared. They accepted a post at the academy to ensure young engineers blend ethics with experimentation, and secretly coordinate a network that hunts down stolen schematics.

### Classes Taught

- **AMCH 101 – Foundational Techno-Magical Engineering**



### Academic Approach

- **Course Focus**: Students analyze mana circuits, information matrices, and modular golem cores, then rebuild them to operate on less volatile arcana.
- **Teaching Style**: Thrymvolin alternates between precise lectures and tinkering sprints, demanding lab notebooks that pair every equation with a field application. Pop practicals require squads to repair malfunctioning constructs under time pressure.
- **Philosophy**: “Elegance is efficiency.” They insist that every machine should serve a larger community, rejecting invention for invention’s sake.

### Faith and Combat Prowess

- **Faith Alignment**: Follows the Prism of Insight, a contemplative order that meditates on crystalline harmony between thought and matter.
- **Combat Style**: Commands swarm-sentinels—amethyst shards that orbit like satellites, projecting restraining fields and siphoning kinetic energy.
- **Signature Move**: *Resonant Lattice*—they assemble floating crystals into a humming cage that locks enemies in stasis while amplifying allies’ spellcasting.

### Classroom & Teaching Environment

The Resonance Workshop thrums with layered energy shields and suspended prototypes. Workbenches glide along rail systems, and mana monitors announce fluctuations with soft chimes. Entry wards scan for unstable enchantments; any student who triggers an alarm must present a full diagnostic before leaving.

### Quotes

- “If the schematic cannot survive scrutiny, the machine will not survive reality.”
- “Magic is simply math that refuses to stay theoretical.”
- “Leave arrogance to tyrants; engineers require humility.”

### Encounter Ideas

- Thrymvolin asks the party to recover a stolen inhibitor crystal before a rival guild reverse-engineers it into a weapon.
- A swarm-sentinel prototype imprints on an adventurer’s aura, forcing them to accompany Thrymvolin into a restricted vault to reset the bond.
- The Resonance Workshop seizes up during finals; the heroes must crawl through the ventilation conduits to release a jammed ley regulator.
