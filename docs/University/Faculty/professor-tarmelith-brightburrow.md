### Tarmelith Brightburrow

Ancient Gold Dragon

### Role

Professor of **Ancient Relics and Artifacts**

**College**: College of Lore

**Major**: Ancient Relics and Artifacts

### Personality

Gracious, principled, and quietly exacting. Tarmelith delights in mentoring, but he demands integrity in research and stewardship. He can be playful with puns before turning razor-sharp on matters of ethics.

### Description

Lustrous gold scales set with filigreed sigils of sovereignty; his horns are capped with tiny diadems used as calibration weights. A warm radiance clings to him, illuminating micro-engraving on metalwork.

### Background

Once a royal archivist and regalia-warden, Tarmelith oversaw coronation rites across shifting dynasties. After exposing a counterfeit succession scepter, he chose the academy over courtly intrigue to train impartial appraisers.

### Classes Taught

- **ARAR 201 – Bones of Kings: Identifying Sovereign Relics**



### Academic Approach

- **Course Focus**: Iconography, metallurgy, and oath-binding enchantments in crowns, thrones, and scepters; separating legitimacy from pageantry.
- **Teaching Style**: Case studies with blind assessments; students authenticate sealed regalia boxes using only non-destructive tests before unsealing.
- **Philosophy**: “Power should fit like a crown—measured, balanced, and earned.”

### Faith and Combat Prowess

- **Faith Alignment**: Warden of Just Succession—oaths to safeguard rightful stewardship and dissolve tyrant’s trinkets.
- **Combat Style**: Radiant counters that unweave coercive compulsion and bolster allies’ resolve.
- **Signature Move**: Coronation’s Verdict—casts a halo that weighs an opponent’s claim and suppresses power gained through deceit.

### Classroom & Teaching Environment

A vault-class seminar room with rotating displays of practice regalia, metallurgical sniffers, and oath-resonance prisms. The lectern is a portable throne frame used for structural analysis.

### Quotes

- “A crown remembers the head that lied.”
- “Metals don’t deceive—until a mage teaches them how.”
- “Legitimacy is an enchantment you cannot fake.”

### Encounter Ideas

- Judge a disputed coronet under hostile scrutiny while a pretender’s mage attempts to spoof signatures.
- Recover a stolen scepter whose oath has been inverted to enthrall crowds.
- Certify a traveling exhibit of regalia before a saboteur salts it with forgeries.
