### Threllix Moraine

Ancient Blue Dragon

### Role

Professor of **Economic Dominance and Resource Management**

**College**: School of Yield Surging

**Major**: Economic Dominance and Resource Management

### Personality

Calculating, charismatic, and relentlessly pragmatic. Threllix prizes leverage that outlasts fashion, and he teaches students to value stable prosperity over pyrrhic dominance.

### Description

Cobalt scales crosshatched like bank ledgers; static prickles the air when he smiles. His crest bears inset trade seals from accords he brokered.

### Background

Once the architect of a resource cartel, Threllix dissolved his own monopoly after it nearly collapsed a river valley economy. He now evangelizes resilient markets and shared safeguards.

### Classes Taught

- **EDRM 238 – Ethics in Resource Domination**



### Academic Approach

- **Course Focus**: Antitrust warding, cartel dynamics, pricing sigils, and supply-shock cushions.
- **Teaching Style**: Case studies, simulated crises, and negotiated settlements scored for net welfare.
- **Philosophy**: Power that cannot survive scrutiny is debt, not wealth.

### Faith and Combat Prowess

- **Faith Alignment**: Compact of Fair Weights—oaths to keep scales honest.
- **Combat Style**: Lightning feints that disable arms while sparing laborers and infrastructure.
- **Signature Move**: Market Calm—disperses frenzy magics and restores orderly bargaining.

### Classroom & Teaching Environment

A trading floor classroom with shifting market boards and a ‘panic bell’ used only for drills.

### Quotes

- "A cornered market corners you back."
- "Stability is the highest dividend."
- "Win the surplus, not the headline."

### Encounter Ideas

- Unwind a price-fixing ring before it triggers famine.
- Broker a water tithe that saves farms and keeps mills running.
- Expose a cursed futures contract rigged to crash a port city.
