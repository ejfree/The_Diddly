### Selvar Thricebound

Ancient Green Dragon

### Role

Professor of **Arcanomechanics**

**College**: Academy of Archano-Elemental and Techno Mechanics

**Major**: Arcanomechanics

### Personality

Cool, calculating, and relentlessly ethical. Selvar makes students sign their designs with the harms they avoided.

### Description

Green scales with ink-dark seams; three braided cords around his neck mark vows he won’t break.

### Background

He walked away from a lucrative war contract to publish its risks. He has been ‘thrice bound’ since: to truth, to users, to those unseen.

### Classes Taught

- **AMCH 238 – Ethics in Magical Engineering**



### Academic Approach

- **Course Focus**: Ethical threat modeling, informed consent in tooling, and sunset clauses for power.
- **Teaching Style**: Design tribunals and stakeholder interviews.
- **Philosophy**: The right to refuse is sacred—design for it.

### Faith and Combat Prowess

- **Faith Alignment**: Covenant of the Third Promise—keep your last vow first.
- **Combat Style**: Vine-binds and countermanding orders that halt machines.
- **Signature Move**: Thricebound Seal—locks a device until consent is given.

### Classroom & Teaching Environment

Tribunal classroom with testimony seats and a ‘harms board’.

### Quotes

- "Write the harms. Now write fewer."
- "Users are not targets."
- "No means no—even to your masterpiece."

### Encounter Ideas

- Force a weapons lab to adopt opt-out switches.
- Design a public interest override for a tyrant’s engine.
- Publish a truth that kills a contract.
