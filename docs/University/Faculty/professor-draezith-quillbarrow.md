## Professor Draezith Quillbarrow

Ancient Moonstone Dragon

### Role

Professor of **History**

**College**: College of Lore

**Major**: History

### Personality

Scholarly, sly, and patient with paradox. Draezith delights in finding the page torn out and reconstructing it from fingerprints.

### Description

Pale opalescent scales that shimmer like pages under moonlight; quills tuck behind a horn ridge.

### Background

Exiled from a royal archive for citing suppressed sources, he learned to hide truths in plain sight. He now trains historians to read between planes.

### Classes Taught

- **HIST 221 – Imperial Archives and the Censor’s Flame**



### Academic Approach

- **Course Focus**: Censored historiography, interplanar cross-referencing, and handling conflicting realities.
- **Teaching Style**: Source triangulation labs, testimony clinics, and night-readings by reflected light.
- **Philosophy**: The past has more than one hallway—walk them all.

### Faith and Combat Prowess

- **Faith Alignment**: Keeper of the Marginalia—vows to preserve what censors miss.
- **Combat Style**: Moon-quiet veils that turn violence aside while evidence is saved.
- **Signature Move**: Quillbarrow Note—pins a lie to the page it came from.

### Classroom & Teaching Environment

Lantern-lit stacks with mirrored shelves leading to ‘parallel’ catalogues.

### Quotes

- "If the archive glares, shade your eyes and keep reading."
- "Where the record fractures, truth refracts."
- "Footnotes are escape tunnels."

### Encounter Ideas

- Smuggle a banned diary across a planar checkpoint.
- Prove two histories happened—then reconcile the treaty that rests on one.
- Catch a censor haunting the margins.
