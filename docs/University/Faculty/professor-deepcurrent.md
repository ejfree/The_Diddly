### Professor Deepcurrent

Ancient Sea Dragon

### Role

Professor of **Elemental Bindings**

**College**: Academy of Archano-Elemental and Techno Mechanics

**Major**: Elemental Binding

### Personality

Professor Deepcurrent is a kindly yet capricious sea dragon whose demeanor often mirrors the ever-changing tides. While his students find him approachable and encouraging, they must also be ready to adapt to his unpredictable shifts in teaching focus. He delights in watching his students tackle challenges, often throwing unexpected problems their way to test their ingenuity.

### Description

Deepcurrent is a long, serpentine dragon with scales in hues of turquoise, deep blue, and sea green, glinting like sunlight on the ocean's surface. His lithe body moves with fluid grace, reminiscent of ocean currents, and his flowing fins shimmer like delicate coral fronds. His golden eyes carry the depth of countless lifetimes, and his voice is like the gentle roar of distant waves. Deepcurrent’s tail is especially powerful, reflecting his heritage as a master of water and weather, and his presence is both calming and awe-inspiring.

### Classes Taught

- ELBD 101 – Intro to Elemental Mechanics

### Academic Approach

- **Course Focus**: Professor Deepcurrent’s course centers on the magic, physics, chemistry, and manipulation of elemental forces, with a special emphasis on water and weather. Students learn the fundamentals of elemental summoning, controlling precipitation, and creating balanced ecosystems.

- **Teaching Style**: His teaching style is hands-on and experiential. Deepcurrent often conducts classes in or near water, using dynamic demonstrations to illustrate complex principles. He challenges students to experiment and fail, believing that true learning comes from the struggle to overcome obstacles.

- **Philosophy**: Deepcurrent believes in harmonizing with the elements rather than dominating them. To him, understanding the intrinsic balance of nature is key to mastering elemental magic. He encourages students to respect the power they wield and to always consider the broader impact of their actions.

### Faith and Combat Prowess

- **Faith Title**: Keeper of the Tides
  **Faith Description**: Deepcurrent reveres the natural cycles of water and weather, seeing them as manifestations of an intricate, divine balance. He often integrates this perspective into his teachings, encouraging students to view magic as a means of maintaining harmony rather than causing destruction.

- **Combat Style**: As a Kineticist, Deepcurrent wields water with unparalleled precision, summoning waves and whirlpools to overwhelm foes. He uses his immense swimming speed and amphibious nature to outmaneuver opponents in aquatic environments.

- **Signature Move**: *Hydroburst Cascade* — Deepcurrent channels an immense ball of water, compressing it with elemental energy before releasing it in a devastating burst that can knock back and disorient enemies.

### Classroom & Teaching Environment

Professor Deepcurrent’s classroom is as unique as his teaching style. Situated within a magically contained lagoon at Dragon University, it features an open-air setting surrounded by cascading waterfalls and shimmering pools. The desks and platforms float on the water’s surface, magically stabilized to remain steady. Elementals often accompany his lectures, providing live demonstrations and engaging students in practical exercises. The sound of flowing water and the fresh scent of the ocean create an immersive learning atmosphere.

### Quotes

- “The ocean does not obey commands; it is a partner, not a servant.”

- “Mastery is not control; it is understanding when to push and when to yield.”

- “A single drop of water may seem insignificant, but together, they form a force no one can withstand.”

### Encounter Ideas

- During a field trip to a nearby elemental plane of water, Professor Deepcurrent asks the party to retrieve a rare elemental artifact, testing their teamwork and resourcefulness.

- Deepcurrent requests help investigating disturbances in the lagoon caused by rogue elementals, leading to a mystery that ties into greater planar imbalances.

- The professor challenges the students to a mock battle using summoned elementals, offering a rare magical reward to the team that impresses him the most.
