### Aerys Nightrend

Ancient Bronze Dragon

### Role

Professor of **Prophecy**

**College**: College of Lore

**Major**: Prophecy

### Personality

Measured, principled, and gently relentless. Aerys believes foreknowledge obligates compassion, not control, and challenges fatalism at every turn.

### Description

Bronze scales brushed like old coin; storm-scent clings to his wings. His voice carries courtroom clarity, even when whispering.

- **Teaching Style**: Case law, tribunal simulations, and reflective praxis that centers those affected by predictions.
- **Philosophy**: Knowledge serves dignity first.

### Faith and Combat Prowess

- **Faith Alignment**: Bronze Compact—oaths that bind truth to mercy.
- **Combat Style**: Lightning interdictions that disable without dehumanizing.
- **Signature Move**: Verdict’s Thunder—stuns aggressors who exploit foreknowledge.

### Classroom & Teaching Environment

Round forum with witness chairs and a ‘future impact’ wall where students post who a decision helps and harms.

### Quotes

- "Seeing ahead is not the same as seeing above."
- "A prophecy without consent is a theft."
- "Protect the person, not the narrative."
