### Background

A once-peripatetic chronicler of borderlands, Whirlwing embedded with clutches and clans across shifting regimes to record how power reorders memory. After witnessing history revised in real time to suit a victor, they vowed to teach students to surf change rather than drown in it—and to annotate every wave.

They challenge students to think critically about the sources of history, question established narratives, and embrace the idea of history as a living, evolving entity.

Professor Whirlwing’s classroom is a testament to their love of change. The space is enchanted to constantly shift its layout and decor, reflecting the themes of the day’s lesson. One day it might resemble an ancient battlefield, complete with holographic projections of dragons and giants clashing, and the next, it could transform into a grand hall filled with artifacts and murals. Despite the ever-changing environment, the classroom maintains an aura of warmth and inspiration, with plenty of spaces for students to gather and discuss ideas. The room’s centerpiece is a massive, floating orb that displays a dynamic timeline of dragon history, which Whirlwing often manipulates during lectures to illustrate key points.
