### Drazorith the Hollow Maw

Ancient Astral Dragon

### Role

Professor of **Ancient Relics and Artifacts**

**College**: College of Lore

**Major**: Ancient Relics and Artifacts

### Personality

Grave, meticulous, and untempted by spectacle. Drazorith treats doomsday devices like fossils—study, don’t awaken.

### Description

Astral-gray scales with void-black edges; his maw seems to swallow light when he frowns.

### Background

Recovered six ‘world-enders’ and dismantled five; the sixth remains sealed in a nameless crate. He teaches restraint stronger than curiosity.

### Classes Taught

- **ARAR 233 – Portable Apocalypse: Weapons of Lost Ages**



### Academic Approach

- **Course Focus**: Weapon reliquaries, kill-switch archaeology, and containment that outlives us.
- **Teaching Style**: Cold-room practicums, layered checklists, and red-stamp authority for students who earn it.
- **Philosophy**: Some power is best remembered, not used.

### Faith and Combat Prowess

- **Faith Alignment**: Oath of the Closed Crate—promises to keep sleeping giants asleep.
- **Combat Style**: Gravity clamps and event-horizon veils that isolate threats.
- **Signature Move**: Hollow Maw Seal—swallows an active artifact’s output into quiet stasis.

### Classroom & Teaching Environment

Windowless vault with redundant locks, decon alcoves, and a chalkboard that never leaves the room.

### Quotes

- "We win when nothing happens."
- "Curate, don’t covet."
- "Close the crate. Write the label. Walk away."

### Encounter Ideas

- Disarm an heirloom that arms itself around heirs.
- Hide a planet-killer from a collector who doesn’t believe in labels.
- Decide whether to destroy a relic that cannot be remade.
