### Karthaz Nullicore

Ancient Black Dragon

### Role

Professor of **Eldritch Engineering**

**College**: Academy of Archano-Elemental and Techno Mechanics

**Major**: Eldritch Engineering

### Personality

Quiet, severe, and clinically curious. Karthaz trusts data over dread and designs void tech that refuses to be cruel.

### Description

Pitch-black scales with matte finish; light seems to slow near his chest where a null-core hums.

### Background

He survived a collapse caused by reckless void extraction and vowed to build containment that fails safe. He publishes every flaw he finds.

### Classes Taught

- **ELEN 202 – Abyssal Resonance and Void Coils**



### Academic Approach

- **Course Focus**: Abyssal resonance, null capacitors, and humane shutdown protocols.
- **Teaching Style**: Black-box tests, negative-pressure drills, and open incident logs.
- **Philosophy**: The void owes you nothing—so owe it nothing back.

### Faith and Combat Prowess

- **Faith Alignment**: Vow of the Empty Hand—never take what you cannot return.
- **Combat Style**: Silence fields that strip hostile spells to inert potential.
- **Signature Move**: Nullicore Sink—drinks a surge and returns it as harmless dark.

### Classroom & Teaching Environment

Negative-pressure lab with umbral curtains and cutout cords labeled like arteries.

### Quotes

- "Fear is not a metric."
- "Publish your failures—they’re the only ones that help."
- "Design like you won’t be there to apologize."

### Encounter Ideas

- Stabilize a null leak under a crowded ward.
- Audit a guild bragging about ‘riskless’ void coils.
- Retrieve a stolen core before it learns hunger.
