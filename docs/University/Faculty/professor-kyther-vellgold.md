### Kyther Vellgold

Ancient Black Dragon

### Role

Professor of **Economic Dominance and Resource Management**

**College**: School of Yield Surging

**Major**: Economic Dominance and Resource Management

### Personality

Sharp, unsentimental, and ruthlessly fair. Kyther teaches that black markets thrive where trust fails—and then shows how to rebuild trust.

### Description

Black scales like lacquered ledgers; a gold thread runs along his spine like a balance line.

### Background

He dismantled a predatory bank by launching a public ledger rival. Now he trains regulators and builders alike.

### Classes Taught

- **EDRM 231 – Draconic Banking Systems**

### Academic Approach

- **Course Focus**: Banking design, anti-corruption wards, and liquidity magic.
- **Teaching Style**: Simulated runs, transparency drills, and incentive redesign.
- **Philosophy**: Make good behavior cheaper than crime.

### Faith and Combat Prowess

- **Faith Alignment**: Oath of Clear Accounts—every debt named.
- **Combat Style**: Ink-black snares that bind fraud and free bystanders.
- **Signature Move**: Vellgold Audit—exposes hidden siphons and shuts them.

### Classroom & Teaching Environment

Mock bank with live ledgers, panic triggers, and community oversight panels.

### Quotes

- "If you can’t explain it, don’t hold it."
- "Trust accrues like interest—if you pay in public."
- "Design against your worst day."

### Encounter Ideas

- Freeze a run engineered by a rival city.
- Clean a cursed vault without breaking payroll.
