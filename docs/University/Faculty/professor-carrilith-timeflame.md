## Professor Carrilith Timeflame

Ancient Time Dragon

### Role

Professor of **Prophecy**

**College**: College of Lore

**Major**: Prophecy

### Personality

Measured, reflective, and fond of letting students ‘arrive’ at answers they already gave you tomorrow. Carrilith treats fate as a draft, never a decree.

### Description

Brass-sunlight scales striated with hourglass glow; embers drift backward when he exhales. His shadow occasionally disagrees with the present.

### Background

Former custodian of a temporal hospice where last chances could be borrowed from tomorrow, he left after learning that borrowed time still costs someone. He now teaches careful edits.

- **PROF 233 – Temporal Ethics: Futures You Can Live With**



### Academic Approach

- **Course Focus**: Causality, counterfactual prophecy, and small-time interventions with durable outcomes.
- **Teaching Style**: Thought experiments, timestamped simulations, and post-intervention audits.
- **Philosophy**: Make the least change that saves the most lives.

### Faith and Combat Prowess

- **Faith Alignment**: Warden of Borrowed Dawn—promises to give back what he must take.
- **Combat Style**: Rewind windows and delay fields that de-escalate rather than erase.
- **Signature Move**: Timeflame Edit—burns away one harmful moment and seals the seam.

### Classroom & Teaching Environment

A clockwork amphitheater with reversible blackboards and a ‘regret ledger’ where students log and learn.

### Quotes

- "Prophecy without consent is theft."
- "Every fixed point was once a choice."
- "We save futures by respecting pasts."

### Encounter Ideas

- Undo a single signature that prevents a war without erasing its warning.
- Rescue a hostage by rerouting a moment of distraction.
- Close a loop a cult opens to farm tragedies.
