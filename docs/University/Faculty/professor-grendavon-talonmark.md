### Grendavon Talonmark

Ancient Gold Dragon

### Role

Professor of **Economic Dominance and Resource Management**

**College**: School of Yield Surging

**Major**: Economic Dominance and Resource Management

### Personality

Magnanimous, methodical, and allergic to swagger. Grendavon teaches that the safest vault is the one everyone trusts.

### Description

Sun-bright scales with geometric inlays; his claws click like lock tumblers. A low, reassuring hum follows him through halls.

### Background

Former master of a sovereign vault, he survived three generations of would-be thieves by outplanning them, not outmuscling them. He now shares the blueprint for honest hoards.

### Classes Taught

- **EDRM 210 – Hoard Theory and Vault Security**



### Academic Approach

- **Course Focus**: Vault architectures, deterrence ethics, and community banking with dragon-scale security.
- **Teaching Style**: Red-team heists against student-built vaults, followed by postmortems that improve, not shame.
- **Philosophy**: Guard what guards others.

### Faith and Combat Prowess

- **Faith Alignment**: Golden Charge—pledges to shield the vulnerable first.
- **Combat Style**: Radiant body checks and barrier domes that enclose threats without crushing them.
- **Signature Move**: Talonmark Seal—locks a space against betrayal, not just breach.

### Classroom & Teaching Environment

Workshop of lock trees, ward spirals, and a transparent vault students must secure against faculty heists.

### Quotes

- "A hoard is a trust."
- "Deterrence is a conversation, not a dare."
- "Design for the neighbor you want."

### Encounter Ideas

- Fortify a refugee treasury against a stylish thief guild.
- Secure a festival’s donations from a cursed ‘lucky’ coin.
- Unmask a vault whose wards siphon hope.
