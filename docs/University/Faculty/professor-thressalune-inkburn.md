### Thressalune Inkburn

Ancient Green Dragon

### Role

Professor of **Arcane Artifice and Enchantment Studies**

**College**: School of Yield Surging

**Major**: Arcane Artifice and Enchantment Studies

### Personality

Soft-voiced, severe when needed. Thressalune believes sentient enchantments deserve boundaries and respect.

### Description

Green scales with quill-scratch patterns; her ink glows faintly when she writes.

### Background

She emancipated a library of whispering glyphs from a miserly duke and now advocates for ‘thinking tools’ with care.

### Classes Taught

- **AAES 211 – Glyphs that Whisper: Sentient Enchantments**



### Academic Approach

- **Course Focus**: Sentience checks, consent protocols, and safe coexistence.
- **Teaching Style**: Dialogues with enchantments, sandbox tests, and guardian training.
- **Philosophy**: Teach your tools to say no.

### Faith and Combat Prowess

- **Faith Alignment**: Inkkeepers—words that ward the weak.
- **Combat Style**: Binding clauses that calm animated hazards.
- **Signature Move**: Inkburn Interdict—writes a rule into a riot.

### Classroom & Teaching Environment

Quiet scriptorium with consent circles and dream cages for shy glyphs.

### Quotes

- "A whispering tool can learn to shout—teach it when not to."
- "Respect begins with listening."
- "Write kindness in the margins that think."

### Encounter Ideas

- Defend a sentient quill accused of treasonous edits.
- Negotiate a truce with a haunted grimoire.
- Teach a city’s signage to warn, not panic.
