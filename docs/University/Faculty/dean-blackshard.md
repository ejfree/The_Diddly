### Dean Blackshard

Ancient Infernal Dragon

### Role

Dean of **Prophecy**

**College**: College of Lore

**Major**: Prophecy

### Personality

Expected intimidating demeanor from an Infernal Dragon, however, they have a very contemplative nature.

### Description

Towering and robust, with an aura that seems to ripple the air around them, Blackshard black scales aren't just reminiscent of molten lava that has solidified into rock —they appear as though actual flames course beneath them, giving off a soft, ominous glow that illuminates their surroundings in a dim, reddish light. This visual effect intensifies whenever they speak, especially when discussing matters of grave importance or dark prophecy.

### Background

Their role at Dragon University isn't just academic; it's also deeply political. Blackshard advises the university's council and other influential figures within the dragon community, providing guidance that is often pivotal in decision-making processes. Despite their somewhat intimidating demeanor, Blackshard is deeply respected and even revered, as many believe that their foresight has spared the dragon community from numerous threats.

### Classes Taught

...

### Academic Approach

- **Course Focus**: As the Dean of Prophecy at the College of Lore, Blackshard is not only an expert in divination but also a scholar of ancient and forbidden texts.
- **Teaching Style**: Specializes in interpreting dark prophecies and their implications for dragonkind.
- **Philosophy**: Blackshard also mentors a select group of students, teaching them the art of scrying, the interpretation of omens, and the ethical implications of using such knowledge. These students are chosen for their potential and resilience, as the path of a prophet is fraught with burdensome truths and moral dilemmas.

### Faith and Combat Prowess

- **Faith Alignment**: High Seer of the Ember Tribunal, a prophetic conclave that chronicles calamities so they can be averted.
- **Combat Style**: Blackshard weaponizes visions, layering wards of molten light while inflicting disorienting glimpses of possible futures on foes.
- **Signature Move**: *Infernal Augury Surge*—he exhales a ribbon of fire that brands enemies with a rune; on Blackshard’s command the rune erupts, forcing the target to experience the doom they intended for others.

### Classroom & Teaching Environment

Their office is filled with scrolls and tomes that are centuries old, some of which are believed to be the only copies in existence. Blackshard is particularly fascinated by the cyclical nature of history and uses their knowledge to draw parallels between past catastrophes and potential future events.

### Quotes

- “Prophecy is a warning, not a script.”
- “Every omen carries a price—pay it before it is demanded.”
- “I do not predict your fate; I hand you the means to change it.”

### Encounter Ideas

- A cryptic omen names the party; Blackshard summons them to decipher whether they are salvation or disaster.
- His vault of prophetic mirrors fractures, releasing reflections that act on their own—he needs outside help to contain them without destroying the visions.
- A rival seer forges a false prophecy to discredit the College of Lore; Blackshard hires the heroes to expose the deception before the council acts on it.
