### Dean Blackshard

Ancient Infernal Dragon

### Role

Dean of **Prophecy**

**College**: College of Lore

**Major**: Prophecy

### Personality

Expected intimidating demeanor from an Infernal Dragon, however, they have a very contemplative nature.

### Description

Towering and robust, with an aura that seems to ripple the air around them, Blackshard black scales aren't just reminiscent of molten lava that has solidified into rock â€”they appear as though actual flames course beneath them, giving off a soft, ominous glow that illuminates their surroundings in a dim, reddish light. This visual effect intensifies whenever they speak, especially when discussing matters of grave importance or dark prophecy.
