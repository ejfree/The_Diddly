### Xel'Quin'thoth

Ancient Brass Dragon

### Role

Professor of **Prophecy**

**College**: College of Lore

**Major**: Prophecy

### Personality

Loquacious, inquisitive, and delightfully tangential. Xel’Quin’thoth collects questions like others collect relics, and he coaxes students into debating until meanings crystallize from the noise.

### Description

Sand-bright brass scales, a voice like distant chimes, and eyes that seem to track constellations only he can see. Ink-stained mouth-corners hint at nights spent annotating dream-logs.

### Background

A desert astronomer turned lexicographer of omens, he mapped the grammar of visions across cultures, from wind-carved scripts to fungus rings in cavern cities. He came to the academy to teach prophecy as comparative linguistics rather than fate.

### Classes Taught

- **PROF 259 – Whispers in the Void: Alien Prophecy Sources**



### Academic Approach

- **Course Focus**: Alien sources of prophecy—xenolinguistics of dreams, non-humanoid auguries, and verifying signals vs. pareidolia.
- **Teaching Style**: Seminar storms; students defend hypotheses with field notes, recordings, and cross-cultural glossaries.
- **Philosophy**: If you can translate it, you can choose how to answer it.

### Faith and Combat Prowess

- **Faith Alignment**: Pilgrim of the Open Question—devotion to curiosity without conquest.
- **Combat Style**: Sonic feints and mirage wards that confuse pursuit while preserving bystanders.
- **Signature Move**: Echo of the Unsaid—amplifies unsent thoughts into a chorus that disorients hostile intent.

### Classroom & Teaching Environment

A tented observatory with sand-covered floors for diagramming in lines and spirals; listening horns capture whispers from the edge of sleep.

### Quotes

- "Every omen has an accent. Learn it."
- "Questions are bridges; cross carefully."
- "Silence speaks—take notes."

### Encounter Ideas

- Decode a series of fungal ring patterns that predict collapses beneath the campus.
- Parley with a dreaming sphinx whose riddles warn of a manufactured prophecy.
- Retrieve a stolen glossary before a cult weaponizes mistranslated portents.
