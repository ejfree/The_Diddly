### Dean Zephyrion

Ancient Time Dragon

### Role

Dean of **Planar Studies**

**College**: Quintessence Institute

**Major**: Planar Studies

### Personality

Zephyrion speaks in measured tones, as if weighing possible futures mid-sentence. He is patient with earnest curiosity but ruthless toward complacency, expecting students to arrive having already explored the tangents he suggested three lectures ago. His humor is dry and often temporal—quips about events that have yet to happen to his audience.

### Description

Archivist Zephyrion commands a majestic presence with purple scales that shimmer like the starlit sky and eyes that mirror the depth of the cosmos.

### Background

Zephyrion once served as a chronomantic cartographer for the draconic conclave, mapping temporal eddies that threatened to erase entire civilizations. He joined the institute after stabilizing a collapsing demi-plane, bringing with him a vault of recorded timelines and a vow to prevent temporal calamity through education.

### Classes Taught

- Planar Studies 110 & 111 Oversight
- Temporal Navigation Workshop
- Field Practicum: Sealing Micro-Rifts

### Academic Approach

- **Course Focus**: Zephyrion trains students to identify planar signatures, chart safe passage through temporal eddies, and document anomalies without causing divergence.
- **Teaching Style**: He conducts lessons inside stabilized time bubbles, rewinding segments so students can observe their own mistakes and choose better outcomes.
- **Philosophy**: Zephyrion is also involved in several multidimensional research projects, collaborating with other deans and scholars from various disciplines to unlock new realms and understand the interconnectedness of all existence. Their research often focuses on the stability of time gates, the effects of planar convergence, and the prevention of cataclysmic planar collapses.

### Faith and Combat Prowess

- **Faith Alignment**: Custodian of the Chronal Wardens, a time-dragon order sworn to preserve the Prime timeline’s integrity.
- **Combat Style**: Zephyrion manipulates temporal momentum, aging threats into frailty or rewinding allies to moments before injury.
- **Signature Move**: *Hourglass Collapse*—he encloses foes in a spinning hourglass of force, forcing them to relive the last minute until they surrender or shatter the loop.

### Classroom & Teaching Environment

Zephyrion's lair, nestled in the highest tower of the Institute, is filled with artifacts from countless dimensions, ancient timepieces that tick in synchrony with different realities, and maps that chart the known and unknown universes. Each item in Zephyrion's collection holds a story of a time-worn journey or a forgotten plane, meticulously documented and preserved.

### Quotes

- “Arrive prepared; we have already covered this lesson tomorrow.”
- “Every choice is a fork in the timeline—pick the one worth remembering.”
- “Observe, record, restore. Interfere only when the alternative is oblivion.”

### Encounter Ideas

- A rogue chronomancer steals fragments from the university’s timeline archive; Zephyrion asks the party to retrieve them before paradox sets in.
- A planar convergence threatens to merge two dormitories across centuries—he needs courageous students to enter the overlap and anchor reality.
- Zephyrion dispatches the heroes to escort an exchange scholar returning from the Far Realm with data so volatile it warps time around her.
