#### Planar Studies

- **Dean Zephyrion (Time Dragon):** Guides students through temporal anomalies and the study of time-related planar phenomena.

The NPC time dragon, known as Archivist Zephyrion, commands a majestic presence with purple scales that shimmer like the starlit sky and eyes that mirror the depth of the cosmos. As the Dean of Planar Studies at the Quintessence Institute in Dragon University, Zephyrion possesses an unmatched intellect in the realms of temporal dynamics and spatial theories. Draw him

Zephyrion's lair, nestled in the highest tower of the Institute, is filled with artifacts from countless dimensions, ancient timepieces that tick in synchrony with different realities, and maps that chart the known and unknown universes. Each item in Zephyrion's collection holds a story of a time-worn journey or a forgotten plane, meticulously documented and preserved.

In their role as dean, Zephyrion not only oversees the academic curriculum but also mentors young dragons in mastering the delicate art of planar travel. They conduct advanced seminars where students learn to sense and manipulate the thin veils separating different dimensions, encouraging them to explore responsibly and always be aware of the temporal footprints they leave behind.

Zephyrion is also involved in several multidimensional research projects, collaborating with other deans and scholars from various disciplines to unlock new realms and understand the interconnectedness of all existence. Their research often focuses on the stability of time gates, the effects of planar convergence, and the prevention of cataclysmic planar collapses.

Under Zephyrion's guidance, the Quintessence Institute has become a beacon of advanced planar studies, attracting scholars and adventurers from across the multiverse, all eager to learn from the wisdom of the time dragon and explore the vast expanses of time and space.
