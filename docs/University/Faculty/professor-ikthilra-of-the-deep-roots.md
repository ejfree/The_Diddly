## Professor Ikthilra of the Deep Roots

Ancient Blue Dragon

### Role

Professor of **History**

**College**: College of Lore

**Major**: History

### Personality

Sardonic, meticulous, and deeply patient. Ikthilra teaches that local histories are sovereign and outsiders must ask permission to interpret them.

### Description

Storm-blue scales with rootlike marbling; her horns are wrapped in thread from villages that hosted her oral histories.

### Background

She spent decades trading stories for shelter along ancient caravan routes, recording how memory negotiates with power. She curates a consent-based archive of community histories.

### Classes Taught

- **HIST 226 – Local Histories: Memory, Myth, and Manipulation**



### Academic Approach

- **Course Focus**: Oral tradition methods, consent protocols, and countering mythic capture by elites.
- **Teaching Style**: Field interviews, participatory mapping, and reflective journals graded for humility.
- **Philosophy**: History belongs to those who live it.

### Faith and Combat Prowess

- **Faith Alignment**: Keeper of the Deep Thread—protects the continuity of small places.
- **Combat Style**: Thunder rolls that scatter crowds without breaking bones.
- **Signature Move**: Root Recall—anchors allies to remembered safe ground, negating forced movement.

### Classroom & Teaching Environment

Workshop lined with community quilts, annotated maps, and a whispering circle where guests recount contested moments.

### Quotes

- "Ask permission, then ask your question."
- "If they can’t recognize themselves in your history, you wrote fiction."
- "Power edits—document the edits."

### Encounter Ideas

- Help a village reclaim a name stolen by a lord’s edict.
- Mediate a festival whose origin myth erases its founders.
- Track a relic that migrates between families by story, not blood.
