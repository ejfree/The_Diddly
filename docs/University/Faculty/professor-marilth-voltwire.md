### Marilth Voltwire

Ancient Amethyst Dragon

### Role

Professor of **Arcane Artifice and Enchantment Studies**

**College**: School of Yield Surging

**Major**: Arcane Artifice and Enchantment Studies

### Personality

Inventive, patient, and obsessive about personalization. Marilth believes tools should learn their users, not the reverse.

### Description

Amethyst scales with faint circuit filigree; her claws click through sigil forms like a practiced musician.

### Background

She designed modular wands for amputee mages and never stopped iterating. Her lab ships accessibility first.

### Classes Taught

- **AAES 218 – Modular Wandcraft and Personal Sigils**



### Academic Approach

- **Course Focus**: Personal sigil dialects, ergonomic enchantment, and safe hot-swapping.
- **Teaching Style**: Pair programming with wands; test suites and user journals.
- **Philosophy**: Empower the wielder, not the weapon.

### Faith and Combat Prowess

- **Faith Alignment**: Prism of Care—function serves dignity.
- **Combat Style**: Adaptive arrays that mirror allies’ styles.
- **Signature Move**: Voltwire Sync—attunes a party’s gear for combined effects.

### Classroom & Teaching Environment

Tool library, swap benches, and a ‘fit clinic’ where designs meet bodies.

### Quotes

- "Customization is compassion in code."
- "Ship safety as a feature, not a footnote."
- "If it hurts to use, it’s broken."

### Encounter Ideas

- Outfit evac teams with bespoke kits overnight.
- Disable a mass-produced wand with a compatibility patch.
- Co-design a spell tool with a non-traditional caster.
