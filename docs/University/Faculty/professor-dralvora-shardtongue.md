### Dralvora Shardtongue

Ancient Silver Dragon

### Role

Professor of **Political Intrigue and Diplomacy**

**College**: Quintessence Institute

**Major**: Political Intrigue and Diplomacy

### Personality

Gracious, unyielding, and exquisitely patient. Dralvora believes the best negotiations rescue dignity on both sides.

### Description

Mirror-bright silver scales with hairline fracture patterns like frost; her voice can cut or cradle with equal precision.

### Background

She brokered evacuations under siege and learned the price of delay. Now she teaches how to speak steel-soft and time-true when lives depend on minutes.

### Classes Taught

- **POLI 231 – Negotiation Under Duress**

### Academic Approach

- **Course Focus**: Crisis bargaining, hostage protocols, and reading ‘third rails’ before they spark.
- **Teaching Style**: High-pressure drills with rotating roles and strict after-action accountability.
- **Philosophy**: Mercy is strategy’s sharpest edge.

### Faith and Combat Prowess

- **Faith Alignment**: Concord of the Quick Word—oaths to spend breath well.
- **Combat Style**: Interdiction lines that freeze aggressors long enough for surrender to be chosen.
- **Signature Move**: Silver Stay—declares a halt that binds the reckless.

### Classroom & Teaching Environment

A negotiation theater with observation booths, heart-rate crystals, and a ‘clock on the table’ for time-boxed talks.

### Quotes

- "Dignity de-escalates."
- "Name the fear; you make it smaller."
- "Never trade lives for pride."

### Encounter Ideas

- Talk down a warlord in ten minutes or less.
- Reunite prisoners with families without paying the ransom.
- Turn a standoff into a surrender with one sentence.
