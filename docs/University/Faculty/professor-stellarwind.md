### Professor Stellarwind

Ancient Vortex Dragon

Professor of **Planar Studies**

**College**: Quintessence Institute

**Major**: Planar Studies

### Personality

Professor Stellarwind is bold and driven, her fiery determination matching the brilliance of the planes she teaches. Despite her origins as a descendant of interplanetary messengers, she has forged her own identity as an explorer and scholar of the most extreme planar environments. Her strong moral compass, rooted in her devotion to Bahamut, guides her teaching and personal life.

She values resilience and bravery in her students, pushing them to expand their understanding of the multiverse's harshest realms while respecting the inherent balance of the planes. She is an inspiring mentor, unyielding in her expectations but fiercely protective of her students.

### Description

Professor Stellarwind is a towering vortex dragon with striking **striped and whorled patterns** that shimmer across her scales, alternating between a brilliant **sky-blue** and a radiant **gold**. Her eyes burn with a fiery glow, reflecting the planar energy she channels as a scholar and paladin. Her wings ripple like cascading auroras, and the edges seem to refract light as if they were portals to other dimensions.

She carries herself with an air of majesty, befitting her ancient status, and her movements exude both grace and latent power. Her fiery breath, tinged with radiant energy, is said to illuminate the shadows of the upper planes.

### Background

Stellarwind earned her honorific while serving as a planar courier for Bahamut’s Concordance, ferrying embassies through storms of astral debris. She joined the Quintessence Institute after leading a rescue mission into a collapsing shard of Arborea, where she refused to leave until every trapped student escaped. Her research now catalogues survival protocols for hostile celestial terrain, and she maintains alliances with angelic legions who owe her more than one life-debt.

A massive circular platform at the center is enchanted to simulate planar conditions, allowing students to experience the environments firsthand. Lectures often conclude with practical exercises, ranging from planar navigation challenges to celestial negotiations.
