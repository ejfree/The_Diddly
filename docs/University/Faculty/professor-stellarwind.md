### Stellarwind

Ancient Vortex Dragon

### Role

Professor of **Planar Studies**

**College**: Quintessence Institute

**Major**: Planar Studies

### Personality

Expansive, analytical, and a touch theatrical. Stellarwind frames lessons as voyages, inviting students to chart questions like star-maps. He is patient with detours that reveal new constellations of thought.

### Description

Slate-blue scales streaked with comet-silver; a perpetual breeze swirls motes around him as if gravity is optional. His eyes reflect distant nebulae, and his voice carries a gentle Doppler drift.

### Background

Former pathfinder for a planar survey flotilla, he pioneered slipstream routes between upper realms and recorded how alignments modulate magic. He retired to the Diddly to teach safer navigation than his younger self practiced.

### Classes Taught

- **PLAN 110 – Upper Planar Explorations**

### Academic Approach

- **Course Focus**: Ecology and ethics of upper planes, safe corridor plotting, and recognizing benevolent hazards.
- **Teaching Style**: Star-table practicums, model cosmos labs, and simulation sails through shifting alignments.
- **Philosophy**: “Wonder is a compass—use it, but carry a map.”

### Faith and Combat Prowess

- **Faith Alignment**: Wayfarer’s Concord—binding oaths to leave fewer scars than footprints.
- **Combat Style**: Vector control and pressure fronts; pins foes in gentle gyres while allies reposition.
- **Signature Move**: Gyre of Benevolent Silence—quells hostile magic in a rotating calm-eye.

### Classroom & Teaching Environment

An orrery hall with articulated planes, drift indicators, and a wind-dome for navigation drills. Choirstones reproduce planar harmonics on command.

### Quotes

- “Plot with humility; travel with awe.”
- “A closed halo today may be a welcoming gate tomorrow.”
- “Never confuse elevation with virtue.”

### Encounter Ideas

- A slipstream opens above campus; Stellarwind needs scouts to seed waymarks before it collapses.
- An upper-plane envoy is lost in a headwind of misplaced mercy; chart a rescue.
- Recover a broken astrolabe that still drags local gravity toward a false zenith.
