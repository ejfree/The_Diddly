Draw him

### Personality
Solarius is regal and supremely confident, embodying the splendor and authority of the sun itself. He carries an air of serene command and speaks in a voice that resonates like a gentle rumble of distant thunder. Solarius sees himself not just as a teacher or a leader, but as a benevolent provider, nurturing the intellectual and economic growth of all those under his stewardship.

### Role at Dragon University
As Dean of Economic Dominance and Resource Management, Solarius is pivotal in shaping the economic strategies of the university. He teaches courses on resource allocation, sustainable growth, and magical economies, blending ancient wisdom with modern theories to equip his students with unparalleled skills. He is especially keen on projects that harness magical energies for agricultural and industrial enhancement, often overseeing grand experiments that seek to increase the bounty of the lands under the university's influence.

His vision includes creating a self-sustaining ecosystem that not only supports Dragon University but also benefits surrounding communities, spreading prosperity as a testament to his benevolent governance.

### Challenges
Despite his grand vision, Solarius sometimes struggles with the more grounded or practical aspects of projects, as his ideas can be overwhelmingly ambitious or abstract. Additionally, his view of all beings as his creations can sometimes lead to tension with those who do not share or appreciate his self-assigned providence, particularly other dragons who may see his attitude as presumptive or overbearing.

Solarius Sunflare remains a central figure in the academic and economic spheres of Dragon University, his influence as radiant and far-reaching as the sun.

——
create an NPC solar dragon that is also a Dean of Economic Dominance and Resource Management in the School of Yield Surging  at the dragon university. Solar dragons see themselves as the source of all light in the vastness of the universe. Thus, all living beings, including dragons from other heritages, are ultimately their creations.
