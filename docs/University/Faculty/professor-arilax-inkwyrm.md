### Arilax Inkwyrm

Ancient Cerulean Dragon

### Role

Professor of **Magical Theory**

**College**: Quintessence Institute

**Major**: Magical Theory

### Personality

Calm, lucid, and wryly curious. Arilax dissolves confusion with patient questions and treats elegance as an ethical duty in magic.

### Description

Cerulean scales like ripples under moonlight; his frills glow when ideas ‘click’. Ink stains his talons from sketching proofs in the air.

### Background

A former spell auditor for an academy fleet, he prevented cascade failures by formalizing harmonic checks. He now codifies best practices for spell reasoning.

### Classes Taught

- **MATH 222 – Arcane Logic and Spell Harmonics**



### Academic Approach

- **Course Focus**: Formal logic in spell design, resonance stability, and proof-driven casting.
- **Teaching Style**: Problem studios, peer proofs, and instrumented demos that show harmonics in real time.
- **Philosophy**: Clarity saves lives.

### Faith and Combat Prowess

- **Faith Alignment**: Concord of Clear Water—truth that reflects cleanly.
- **Combat Style**: Flow-control barriers that redirect force into harmless eddies.
- **Signature Move**: Inkwyrm Axiom—imposes a logical constraint that collapses unstable spells.

### Classroom & Teaching Environment

Tiered lab with resonance pools, ripple-boards, and quill-wands that record derivations as light.

### Quotes

- "If it can’t be proven, don’t cast it near friends."
- "Harmony is rigor you can hear."
- "Start simple; finish safer."

### Encounter Ideas

- Diagnose a city ward singing itself off-key.
- Prove a miracle merchant’s wares violate conservation.
- Re-derive a lost counterspell from first principles.
