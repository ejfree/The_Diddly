### Razhin the Taxblight

Ancient Brass Dragon

### Role

Professor of **Economic Dominance and Resource Management**

**College**: School of Yield Surging

**Major**: Economic Dominance and Resource Management

### Personality

Witty, needling, and devastating with a balance sheet. Razhin makes predation unprofitable.

### Description

Brass scales with coin-bright edges; his smile is a receipt.

### Background

He turned a warlord’s tribute web into a welfare net overnight by flipping its ledgers and never looked back.

### Classes Taught

- **EDRM 218 – Trade Wars: Economic Aggression and Countermeasures**



### Academic Approach

- **Course Focus**: Tariffs, sanctions, and countermeasures that spare civilians.
- **Teaching Style**: Wargame markets and press conferences; measure outcomes, not outrage.
- **Philosophy**: Hurt the harm, not the harmed.

### Faith and Combat Prowess

- **Faith Alignment**: Street Tithe—pay forward the surplus.
- **Combat Style**: Shouting prices until bandits can’t afford to fight.
- **Signature Move**: Taxblight Clause—binds aggressors to restitution if they proceed.

### Classroom & Teaching Environment

Briefing room with maps, tariff boards, and a press dais for mock statements.

### Quotes

- "Make cruelty cost more than kindness."
- "Numbers are blades—aim well."
- "If peasants pay, you failed."

### Encounter Ideas

- Starve a slaver port with lawful levers.
- Sanction a tyrant’s pet bank into helping refugees.
- Unwind a blockade without a battle.
