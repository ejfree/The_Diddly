### Vaskra Veinsong

Ancient Occult Dragon

### Role

Professor of **Eldritch Engineering**

**College**: Academy of Archano-Elemental and Techno Mechanics

**Major**: Eldritch Engineering

### Personality

Soft-spoken, uncanny, and fiercely ethical. Vaskra delights in harmonizing living systems with engineered purpose, never at the expense of autonomy.

### Description

Amethyst-dark scales laced with bioluminescent veins that pulse to a steady heartbeat; delicate instruments sing faintly when she enters a room.

### Background

Once a clandestine consultant for bio-weapon labs, she leaked their notes and pioneered consent-bound interfaces. She now teaches integration that heals, not harvests.

### Classes Taught

- **ELEN 227 – Bio-Eldritch Integration**



### Academic Approach

- **Course Focus**: Biotic feedback loops, graft ethics, and symbiont-safe power delivery.
- **Teaching Style**: Iterative prototyping with living analogs; consent protocols graded as strictly as performance.
- **Philosophy**: No tool is worth a stolen heartbeat.

### Faith and Combat Prowess

- **Faith Alignment**: Veil of Living Accord—sanctifies willful cooperation over coercion.
- **Combat Style**: Resonant lullabies that pacify predators while bolstering allies’ stamina.
- **Signature Move**: Vein Chorus—overlays enemy rhythms with stabilizing harmonics, nullifying frenzy.

### Classroom & Teaching Environment

A bright wetlab with warded terraria and consent sigil-lamps that glow only when participants agree.

### Quotes

- "Integration without consent is invasion."
- "If it won’t sing with you, don’t wire it."
- "Repair the bond first; power will follow."

### Encounter Ideas

- Deprogram a war-symbiont bonded to a veteran who wants peace.
- Rescue a sapient graft farmed by a rogue guild.
- Stabilize a town’s life-support tree suffering from corrupted mana.
