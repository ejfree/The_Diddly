### Ralin Hexstep

Ancient Blue Dragon

### Role

Professor of **Eldritch Engineering**

**College**: Academy of Archano-Elemental and Techno Mechanics

**Major**: Eldritch Engineering

### Personality

Precise, sardonic, and allergic to handwaving. Ralin insists geometry is kindness when lives are on the line.

### Description

Blue scales etched with hex patterns; sparks trace polygons when he gestures.

### Background

He rebuilt a collapsed ward grid by redrawing arrays in the rain with chalk and stubbornness. He now teaches redundancy like religion.

### Classes Taught

- **ELEN 219 – Geometric Binding Arrays**



### Academic Approach

- **Course Focus**: Array topology, failover design, and error margins.
- **Teaching Style**: Problem sets, field chalk-labs, and stress tests.
- **Philosophy**: Pretty is for posters; safe is for cities.

### Faith and Combat Prowess

- **Faith Alignment**: Hex Covenant—six chances to not die.
- **Combat Style**: Lightning grids that corral violence.
- **Signature Move**: Hexstep Pivot—reindexes an array mid-fight to save an ally.

### Classroom & Teaching Environment

Chalkyard with weather wards, array boards, and a ‘messy math’ gallery.

### Quotes

- "Draw it right; sleep at night."
- "Proof is a love language."
- "Margins are mercies."

### Encounter Ideas

- Shore up a city grid during a siege.
- Debug an ancient array that hates modern math.
- Design a pop-up ward for a refugee camp.
