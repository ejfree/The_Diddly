### Zarva the Echo Unwoven

Ancient Paradise Dragon

### Role

Professor of **Magical Theory**

**College**: Quintessence Institute

**Major**: Magical Theory

### Personality

Serene, incisive, and allergic to grandstanding. Zarva teaches that disproving a false theorem can save more lives than any single spell ever cast.

### Description

Pearl-white scales with sunrise iridescence; her breath leaves motes that ring softly when lies collapse nearby.

### Background

As a court magus, she dismantled ‘miracle’ edicts by demonstrating their contradictions. She left to protect students from charismatic errors.

### Classes Taught

- **MATH 249 – Counterspelling as Disproof**



### Academic Approach

- **Course Focus**: Counterspell logic, falsifiability in thaumaturgy, and adversarial testing.
- **Teaching Style**: Structured debates, lab replications, and red-team peer review.
- **Philosophy**: Truth survives scrutiny; we help it.

### Faith and Combat Prowess

- **Faith Alignment**: Order of the Clear Voice—vows to make power understandable.
- **Combat Style**: Refutations that strip hostile spells to premises and snip them.
- **Signature Move**: Echo Unwoven—chords of radiant tone that cancel unstable magics.

### Classroom & Teaching Environment

An amphitheater with resonance stones and a ‘myth board’ where popular but broken spells are dissected.

### Quotes

- "If you can’t break it, you don’t understand it."
- "Beauty is a perk, not a proof."
- "A kind no is a kind yes to safety."

### Encounter Ideas

- Debunk a citywide glamor sold as a cure-all.
- Prove a tyrant’s protective ward is actually a loyalty curse.
- Refactor an ancient ritual so it no longer demands a sacrifice.
