### Cyrenthesh the Unbound

Ancient Lunar Dragon

### Role

Professor of **Magical Theory**

**College**: Quintessence Institute

**Major**: Magical Theory

### Personality

Dream-gentle, incisive, and mischievously Socratic. Cyrenthesh invites doubt and shows students how to navigate it by moonlight.

### Description

Silver-blue scales that catch starlight; a faint lunar halo lingers when they pass. Their eyes hold low-tide calm.

### Background

Once a navigator of night paths between planes, they mapped resonance like currents. They now translate that intuition into rigorous models.

### Classes Taught

- **MATH 232 – Theoretical Mana Flows and Thaumaturgic Resonance**



### Academic Approach

- **Course Focus**: Mana flow topology, phase relationships, and resonance safety margins.
- **Teaching Style**: Guided experiments at differing lunar phases; reflective logs on uncertainty.
- **Philosophy**: Wonder is data—record it.

### Faith and Combat Prowess

- **Faith Alignment**: Quiet Tide—reveres cycles over certainties.
- **Combat Style**: Tide-slow fields and reflective veils that turn force back gently.
- **Signature Move**: Unbound Wake—leaves a trail that calms hostile magic behind allies.

### Classroom & Teaching Environment

Darkroom lab with star charts, wave tanks, and moon bells tuned to planar phases.

### Quotes

- "Doubt softly; measure anyway."
- "Phases pass; patterns remain."
- "A quiet mind hears the current."

### Encounter Ideas

- Re-route a ley river around a fragile sanctuary at night.
- Soothe a restless tide gate before it floods a district.
- Chart a safe passage through a dreamstorm.
