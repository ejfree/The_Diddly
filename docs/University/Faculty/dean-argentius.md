### Background

Born amidst the snowy peaks of the Elder Mountains, Argentius the Lorewarden has lived for several millennia, witnessing the ebb and flow of countless civilizations. With a natural proclivity for history and a deep-seated desire to preserve the past, Argentius the Lorewarden joined the College of Lore, eventually rising to the position of Dean of History. Known for an unparalleled dedication to historical accuracy, Argentius the Lorewarden has amassed one of the most comprehensive archives of dragon lore and mortal history.

### Classes Taught

- **HIST 104 – The Dawn of Dragonkind**



### Academic Approach

- **Course Focus**: Argentius guides students through comparative chronicles, showing how a single event ripples across cultures and epochs.
- **Teaching Style**: He pairs lecture with primary source immersion—students handle safeguarded tablets while Argentius interprets them in real time, emphasizing evidence-based debate.
- **Philosophy**: “Memory is a duty.” He believes history should inform present action, so every assignment ends with a reflection on how the past shapes tomorrow’s choices.

### Faith and Combat Prowess

- **Faith Alignment**: Devotee of Aureon’s Concordance, a scholarly order that treats truthful record-keeping as sacred liturgy.
- **Combat Style**: Argentius wields timeline wards and chronal shackles, intercepting hostile blows with layers of frozen moments.
- **Signature Move**: *Chronicle Reversal*—he rewinds a single violent action, forcing aggressors to relive their mistake while allies reposition unscathed.

### Classroom & Teaching Environment

His primary lecture hall, the Argent Codex, is a circular chamber lined with floating book-rings. Each seat comes with an illusionary lectern that projects archival scenes as Argentius narrates. Scribing quills hover nearby, automatically compiling annotated timelines for every student.

### Quotes

- “If you cannot cite your source, you are telling a story—not history.”
- “Empires fall, but the lesson they teach is immortal.”
- “We do not guard relics for nostalgia—we guard them so we never repeat their tragedies.”

### Encounter Ideas

- Argentius requests the party recover a stolen chronicle tablet before its prophecy falls into hostile claws.
- He hires the heroes to escort a delegation of archivists through a war zone to record events without interference.
- A temporal anomaly blooms in the archives; Argentius needs impartial agents to investigate without altering the timeline.
