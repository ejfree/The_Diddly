**Professor/Dean Nyxar Veilcore
Name**: Nyxar Veilcore

**Dragon Type**: Umbral Dragon

**Gender**: Male

**Age**: Ancient

**Role:**
Professor of **Subterranean Threats & Gemfield Harvesting**

**Major**: MIN402 - Advanced Mineral Extraction & Refinement

**Personality:**
Professor Nyxar Veilcore is coldly analytical, with a piercing presence that causes even confident students to second-guess their answers. He is meticulous, calculating, and eerily quiet, often allowing long silences to stretch before responding with laser-precise corrections. Though not outwardly cruel, he takes visible delight when students fall into well-laid traps during field assignments—viewing every failure as a lesson worth its weight in adamantine. Beneath the intimidation, however, lies a strict code of honor. He despises inefficiency, laziness, and especially anything that resembles necromancy or undeath, which he considers a perversion of natural cycles.

**Description:**
Professor Veilcore is a towering umbral dragon with angular features and overlapping scales in shades of shadowed pewter and obsidian. His wings stretch wide like torn curtains of night, and his eyes are pinpricks of pale violet that seem to track movement in other dimensions. His claws are always immaculately polished, often embedded with rare gem dust from past mining expeditions. Students say he "flickers" in the corner of one’s vision—never fully visible unless he wants to be. He wears a harness laden with mining tools, calipers, and coils of tripwire beside elegant velvet scroll cases filled with gemstone schematics.

**Academic Approach:**

* **Course Focus**: Mastery of mineral composition, subterranean threats (especially undead remnants), and practical applications of trapsetting to guard precious resources or navigate volatile veins.

* **Teaching Style**: Practical immersion and high-risk field scenarios; his "labs" are unlit tunnels full of active hazards and creatures drawn to mineral-rich zones.

* **Philosophy**: "The earth hides its wealth beneath death and pressure. Learn to crawl through the dark, and you'll find light in your claws."

**Faith and Combat Prowess:**

* **Apostate of Shadowed Purity**: Veilcore does not worship in the traditional sense but adheres to a monastic Shadow Plane ideal—purging undeath and rot to preserve the purity of natural death.

* **Combat Style**: Rogue-based ambusher with expert trap usage. He begins encounters from concealment, disables undead enemies with debilitating snares, and uses darkness and misdirection to dismantle foes one by one.

* **Signature Move**: **Graveglass Pinion** – Veilcore unfurls his wings and launches barbed shadow-glass shards infused with positive energy into undead targets. Each successful hit reduces the target’s AC and deals precision damage over time if they attempt to move or attack.

**Classroom & Teaching Environment:**
Nyxar’s classroom is not so much a room as a descending shaft below the earth, lit only by glimmering geodes and bioluminescent moss. His lectures take place amidst hanging crystals, hidden pressure plates, and mechanical extraction drills. Skeletons from failed tunnelers are left intact as "case studies." A whispering tunnel system allows him to speak from anywhere—his voice echoing through the stone like a test of your nerves. The main chamber, “The Veinheart,” is ringed with fragmented maps, trapped gemstone displays, and artifacts sealed behind ghost wards.

**Quotes:**

* “If you can see it, someone else already claimed it. Learn to find the minerals that *hide.*”

* “Traps are honest. They do only what they are made to do. Unlike people.”

* “I once mined a diamond from the ribs of a vampire prince. Ask me how he died.”

* “You may die in this class. But you will *never* be reborn as one of them.”

**Encounter Ideas**:

* **Field Trip Gone Wrong**: Students (and the party) are caught in a trap-hardened cave system where undead miners rise from the walls. Veilcore appears midway, annoyed that they triggered his “assessment gauntlet” too early.

* **Night Gem Smugglers**: Veilcore hires the adventurers to intercept a stolen crate of shadow sapphires—deadly to undead and too valuable to lose. But the smugglers are undead themselves.

* **The Vein that Screams**: A newly discovered mineral seam emits psychic wails and attracts ghosts. Veilcore is studying it but needs protection while he extracts the “heartstone” beneath it.

* **Test of Darkness**: During finals, students must retrieve a gem from a maze of magical traps without light. Veilcore invites the party to “audit” by surviving the same course—with undead ex-students roaming inside.
