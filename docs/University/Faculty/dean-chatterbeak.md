### Dean Chatterbeak

Ancient Brass Dragon

### Role

Dean of **Ancient Relics and Artifacts**

**College**: College of Lore

**Major**: Ancient Relics and Artifacts

### Personality

With a deep, resonant voice that commands attention, Chatterbeak is not only an administrator but also an active educator, often seen lecturing passionately about the cultural significance of relics or leading heated discussions on the ethics of artifact restoration and preservation.

### Description

Chatterbeak’s bronze feathers are streaked with verdigris, a patina earned from decades spent in forgotten vaults. His beak is engraved with tiny glyphs—field notes inscribed during long expeditions—and delicate spectacles perch at its tip. He wears a bandolier of quills and translation charms, ready to document discoveries the instant they surface.

### Classes Taught

- Ancient Relics Survey - ARF 201
- Provenance & Restoration Workshop
- Oral Histories of the Draconic Diaspora

### Academic Approach

- **Course Focus**: He emphasizes provenance, ensuring students learn to trace every artifact to its cultural context before attempting so much as a cleaning cantrip.
- **Teaching Style**: Chatterbeak treats classes like guided museum tours—students rotate through curated stations, debating in lively squawks while he peppers them with questions that force critical observation.
- **Philosophy**: “Every relic wants to be remembered, not owned.” He champions collaborative stewardship over hoarding, urging students to return items when appropriate.

### Faith and Combat Prowess

- **Faith Alignment**: Devout of the Archivist’s Chorus, a brass-dragon cantor order that sanctifies stories before they fade.
- **Combat Style**: Uses resonant blasts and artifact-empowered illusions, turning opponents’ greed against them with bait-and-switch decoys.
- **Signature Move**: *Echoing Inventory*—Chatterbeak animates spectral replicas of cataloged relics that bind thieves in chains of recorded memory.

### Classroom & Teaching Environment

Chatterbeak's lair, nestled deep within the College's grand library, is a treasure trove of artifacts collected from numerous expeditions across the mythical realms. Each piece, from faded scrolls to intricately carved statuettes, holds a story that Chatterbeak has painstakingly uncovered and cataloged. His office is a reflection of his mind—organized chaos, with piles of books, maps, and relics carefully arranged for easy access.

### Quotes

- “A relic without context is just a shiny lie.”
- “Ask the artifact a question; it will answer—if you’ve done your reading.”
- “Preservation is conversation across centuries.”

### Encounter Ideas

- Chatterbeak hires the party to negotiate with kobold archivists who refuse to part with a tablet the university desperately needs for research.
- A cursed idol mailed anonymously to his office begins whispering to students—he asks the heroes to trace its sender and break the enchantment.
- During a gala exhibit, rival treasure hunters stage a heist; Chatterbeak recruits the adventurers as “guest docents” to thwart the theft without damaging priceless pieces.
