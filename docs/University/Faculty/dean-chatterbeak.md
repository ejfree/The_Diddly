#### Ancient Relics and Artifacts

- **Dean Chatterbeak (Brass Dragon):** An expert in deciphering the lore behind artifacts, making them relatable through stories.

The NPC brass dragon, known as Dean Chatterbeak, holds the prestigious position of Dean of Ancient Relics and Artifacts at the College of Lore in Dragon University.

Chatterbeak lair, nestled deep within the College's grand library, is a treasure trove of artifacts collected from numerous expeditions across the mythical realms. Each piece, from faded scrolls to intricately carved statuettes, holds a story that Chatterbeak has painstakingly uncovered and cataloged. His office is a reflection of his mind—organized chaos, with piles of books, maps, and relics carefully arranged for easy access.

With a deep, resonant voice that commands attention, Chatterbeak is not only an administrator but also an active educator, often seen lecturing passionately about the cultural significance of relics or leading heated discussions on the ethics of artifact restoration and preservation.

Dean Chatterbeak expertise is not limited to mere collection and study; he is deeply involved in magical research that aims to unlock the latent powers held within ancient objects. His work often intersects with magical theory, making him a frequent collaborator with other departments at Dragon University, especially with those focused on magical applications.

Moreover, Chatterbeak is known for his mentoring spirit. Young dragons and other creatures from the university flock to him for guidance on their theses and research projects, knowing that his vast experience can illuminate paths they hadn't even considered.

In the broader academic community, Tharivol is a Chatterbeak figure, often called upon to mediate disputes over artifact claims or to offer his expertise at international conferences. Despite his responsibilities, he remains deeply connected to the thrill of discovery, often taking sabbaticals to lead excavations or to explore new lands, always returning with new knowledge and relics that enrich the university's collections.
