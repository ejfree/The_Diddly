### Velmira Dustwing

Ancient Cerulean Dragon

### Role

Professor of **Ancient Relics and Artifacts**

**College**: College of Lore

**Major**: Ancient Relics and Artifacts

### Personality

Measured, meticulous, and unfailingly calm. Velmira treats damaged relics like patients—triaging, stabilizing, and only then restoring. She praises precision and restraint over flashy results.

### Description

Her cerulean scales fade to sea-glass transparency along the wings, veined like fine craquelure. Tools nest in magnetized bracers: jeweler’s loupes, rune picks, and capillary wands that wick old oils from porous stone.

### Background

Former chief conservator of a coastal reliquary, Velmira pioneered aqueous suspension techniques to rehydrate desiccated parchments and lift curses without stressing fibers. She joined the Diddly to build a restoration program rooted in conservation ethics.

### Classes Taught

- **ARAR 225 – Relic Appraisal and Restoration**



### Academic Approach

- **Course Focus**: Non-destructive analysis, curse-safe handling, and restoration documentation that can withstand legal scrutiny.
- **Teaching Style**: Lab-first instruction with rotating restoration benches; every fix must be reversible and fully logged.
- **Philosophy**: “We heal objects by honoring their scars.”

### Faith and Combat Prowess

- **Faith Alignment**: Conservator’s Vow—preserve lineage memory and return artifacts to rightful custodians.
- **Combat Style**: Fluid, deflective forms that redirect force; hydromancy quenches volatile enchantments.
- **Signature Move**: Silt Veil—suspends a battlefield in slow-flowing wardwater, dampening curses and arresting shrapnel midair.

### Classroom & Teaching Environment

Bright, humidity-controlled atelier with curse hoods, spectral microscopes, and a “wet room” for aqueous lifts. A wall-length light table displays before/after overlays for each project.

### Quotes

- “If your fix isn’t reversible, it isn’t a fix.”
- “Curses are just contaminants with opinions.”
- “Document first. Touch second. Restore last.”

### Encounter Ideas

- A visiting dignitary brings a crown with a hairline curse; perform a live, reversible stabilization before it cracks.
- Salvage reliquaries from a flooded crypt without waking the guardians bound to them.
- Expose a forged provenance by reproducing tool marks under starlight.
