### Veska’laar

Ancient Gold Dragon

### Role

Professor of **Planar Studies**

**College**: Quintessence Institute

**Major**: Planar Studies

### Personality

Warm, discerning, and aspirational. Veska’laar frames exploration as a moral project: discovery must widen safety and dignity across planes.

### Description

Sunlit gold scales with faint auroral edges; her wings cast a gentle radiance that calms rattled nerves. She wears a simple torque etched in star positions no chart yet maps.

### Background

Former envoy to nascent realms, she brokered first-contact protocols that prevented “flag-planting” disasters. She now mentors pathfinders to chart without conquest.

### Classes Taught

- **PLAN 238 – The Eighth Horizon: Undiscovered Planes**



### Academic Approach

- **Course Focus**: Survey ethics, unknown-environment triage, and stabilization of emergent corridors.
- **Teaching Style**: Expedition charrettes, scenario planning, and reflective debriefs centered on affected communities.
- **Philosophy**: The map serves the people on it first.

### Faith and Combat Prowess

- **Faith Alignment**: Radiant Compact—sworn to illuminate without blinding.
- **Combat Style**: Protective aegises and gravity-softening auras that turn lethal falls into safe landings.
- **Signature Move**: Horizon Blessing—sanctifies a corridor to resist corruption and predation.

### Classroom & Teaching Environment

An expeditionarium lined with modular kits and a small “unknowns wall” where students post risks they cannot yet quantify.

### Quotes

- "A first step sets the tone for every step after."
- "Discovery is a promise—keep it gentle."
- "Map the people before the path."

### Encounter Ideas

- Chart around a nascent mind-storm that imprints travelers with borrowed memories.
- Negotiate with a frontier realm’s custodians who speak in seasonal rites.
- Rescue a survey team trapped by a corridor that refuses to end.
