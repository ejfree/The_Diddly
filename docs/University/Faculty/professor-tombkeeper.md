### Professor Tombkeeper

Ancient Crypt Dragon

### Role

Professor of **Prophecy**

**College**: College of Lore

**Major**: Prophecy

### Personality

Professor Tombkeeper is naturally solitary, often withdrawing to his private chambers or patrolling the boundaries between life and death in search of anomalies. He prefers solitude and contemplation, using his time alone to unravel the mysteries of the universe. Despite his intimidating presence, Professor Tombkeeper is not without a sense of duty. He feels a deep responsibility to guide lost souls and correct the imbalances he encounters in the cosmos. His dedication to his role as a guardian of the afterlife is unwavering.

### Description

Professor Tombkeeper is of considerable size, roughly the dimensions of an ancient dragon, though he tends to move with a quiet grace that belies his massive form. His body is streamlined, with long, sinuous limbs and a tail that trails behind him like a wisp of fog. His scales are a pale, milky white, reminiscent of bone or ghostly mist. They seem almost translucent, allowing glimpses of the shadows beneath. The scales themselves are smooth but have an otherworldly sheen, as if they are infused with the essence of the souls he oversees. His head is elongated and angular, with a pronounced brow ridge and deep-set eyes. One of his eyes is covered by a dark eyepatch, giving him a more fearsome, experienced look. His remaining eye glows faintly with a ghostly blue light, exuding an aura of profound knowledge and a connection to the beyond.

### Classes Taught

- **[Foundations of the Draconic Prophecy](../Academics/course-catalog.md#foundations-of-the-draconic-prophecy)**

### Academic Approach

- **Course Focus**: Tombkeeper guides students through prophecy as it relates to cycles of life, death, and rebirth, dissecting omens carved into tomb walls and funeral rites.
- **Teaching Style**: Lectures alternate with pilgrimages to memorial sites—students recite verses among mausoleums while he interprets the echo of each line. He favors Socratic questions that leave the class contemplating long after dismissal.
- **Philosophy**: “Prophecy is mercy for the unprepared.” He urges scholars to confront mortality so they can navigate destinies without fear.

### Faith and Combat Prowess

- **Faith Alignment**: Curator of Chronepsis’ Silent Reliquary, sworn to keep records of every dragon whose fate was foretold.
- **Combat Style**: Wields necrotic breath tempered with restorative undertones, draining hostile spirits while fortifying allies with borrowed vitality.
- **Signature Move**
  - **Negative Energy Mastery:** His mastery over negative energy allows him to manipulate and harness it for various purposes. Whether it's draining the life force from a target or reinforcing his own vitality with the essence of the dead, he wields this energy with precision.

  - **Incongruity Detection:** He possesses an innate ability to sense disturbances in the natural order of life and death. This sense alerts him to any anomalies, such as souls that have not moved on or places where the boundaries between planes have weakened.

  - **Plane Shifting:** As a crypt dragon, Professor Tombkeeper can shift between the material plane and various other planes, particularly those connected to death and the afterlife, such as the Shadow Plane or the Ethereal Plane. This ability makes him a master of navigating the different dimensions of existence.

### Classroom & Teaching Environment

In the classroom, he is a stern and enigmatic teacher. He speaks in a measured, almost haunting tone, with words that carry the weight of ancient knowledge and untold secrets. His teaching methods are rigorous, demanding his students to think beyond the material world and grasp the intricacies of draconic prophecy.

### Quotes

- “We do not fear the grave; we converse with it.”
- “A prophecy ignored is a debt compounded.”
- “When the dead whisper, listen closely—they have already paid the price of knowledge.”

### Encounter Ideas

- Tombkeeper asks the party to escort souls displaced by a botched resurrection back to their rightful vessels.
- A rival cult attempts to forge counterfeit prophecies; Tombkeeper enlists the heroes to expose the forgeries before they spark a panic.
- The professor guides the adventurers through a dream of their own death so they can avert it—if they can decipher the symbolism in time.
