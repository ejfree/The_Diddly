In a Pathfinder 2E (PF2E) environment, Professor Tombkeeper, the crypt dragon, would be a formidable and enigmatic figure. His presence is commanding yet subtly unnerving, with his milky white scales giving off an ethereal glow that contrasts starkly with the darkness of his domain. His large frame is sleek and sinewy, embodying a creature that is both powerful and agile, suited for navigating the shadowy realms of the afterlife and the planes.

**Appearance:**

- **Size and Build:** As a crypt dragon, Professor Tombkeeper is of considerable size, roughly the dimensions of an ancient dragon, though he tends to move with a quiet grace that belies his massive form. His body is streamlined, with long, sinuous limbs and a tail that trails behind him

like a wisp of fog.

- **Scales:** His scales are a pale, milky white, reminiscent of bone or ghostly mist. They seem almost translucent, allowing glimpses of the shadows beneath. The scales themselves are smooth but have an otherworldly sheen, as if they are infused with the essence of the souls he oversees.

- **Head and Features:** His head is elongated and angular, with a pronounced brow ridge and deep-set eyes. One of his eyes is covered by a dark eyepatch, giving him a more fearsome, experienced look. His remaining eye glows faintly with a ghostly blue light, exuding an aura of profound knowledge and a connection to the beyond.

- **Horns and Spines:** He sports a crown of curved, obsidian-like horns that arch backward, their sharp edges glinting ominously. Along his spine runs a series of jagged spines, each one tapering off to a sharp point, adding to his imposing silhouette.

- **Wings:** His wings are vast and bat-like, but instead of leathery membranes, they appear more spectral, as if made from the very fabric of the shadowy planes he frequents. When unfurled, they stretch wide, but when folded, they seem to dissipate into thin air.

- **Breath Weapon:** As a crypt dragon, Professor Tombkeeper breathes a negative energy-infused mist, dealing negative energy damage. This breath weapon drains vitality, corrodes life force, and leaves those caught in its wake with a sense of deep, existential dread.

**Personality and Demeanor:**

- **Solitary Nature:** Professor Tombkeeper is naturally solitary, often withdrawing to his private chambers or patrolling the boundaries between life and death in search of anomalies. He prefers solitude and contemplation, using his time alone to unravel the mysteries of the universe.

- **Stern and Mysterious:** In the classroom, he is a stern and enigmatic teacher. He speaks in a measured, almost haunting tone, with words that carry the weight of ancient knowledge and untold secrets. His teaching methods are rigorous, demanding his students to think beyond the material world and grasp the intricacies of draconic prophecy.

- **Guiding the Lost:** Despite his intimidating presence, Professor Tombkeeper is not without a sense of duty. He feels a deep responsibility to guide lost souls and correct the imbalances he encounters in the cosmos. His dedication to his role as a guardian of the afterlife is unwavering.

**Abilities and Powers:**

- **Negative Energy Mastery:** His mastery over negative energy allows him to manipulate and harness it for various purposes. Whether it's draining the life force from a target or reinforcing his own vitality with the essence of the dead, he wields this energy with precision.

- **Incongruity Detection:** He possesses an innate ability to sense disturbances in the natural order of life and death. This sense alerts him to any anomalies, such as souls that have not moved on or places where the boundaries between planes have weakened.

- **Plane Shifting:** As a crypt dragon, Professor Tombkeeper can shift between the material plane and various other planes, particularly those connected to death and the afterlife, such as the Shadow Plane or the Ethereal Plane. This ability makes him a master of navigating the different dimensions of existence.

**Role in PF2E:**

- **Patron or Mentor:** In a PF2E campaign, Professor Tombkeeper could serve as a patron or mentor to the players, offering them guidance on matters related to the afterlife, necromancy, or prophecy. He might send them on quests to resolve disturbances in the natural order or to retrieve lost artifacts connected to draconic prophecy.

- **Antagonist or Challenge:** Alternatively, he could be an antagonist, especially if the players' actions disrupt the delicate balance of life and death, forcing him to intervene. His powers and knowledge of negative energy would make him a formidable challenge.

- **Quest Giver:** He could be the source of deep, arcane knowledge or ancient prophecies that the players need to decipher, requiring them to earn his trust or prove their worthiness to learn from him.

Overall, Professor Tombkeeper would be a unique and intriguing character in any PF2E setting, blending the mystical elements of draconic prophecy with the eerie, otherworldly qualities of a crypt dragon.

Professor Tombkeeper is a male crypt dragon, they are solitary dragons who patrol the planes and purgatory searching for signs of incongruity with deaths & souls. You breathe negative damage. You are a milky white dragon and have an eyepatch.
