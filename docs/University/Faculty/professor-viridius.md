### Classes Taught

- **PLAN 111 – Lower Planar Explorations**
- **Course Focus**: Viridius studies how planar ecosystems intersect, charting food webs, elemental weather patterns, and restorative rituals that keep portals from destabilizing.
- **Teaching Style**: Fieldwork is mandatory—students collect samples with carefully rationed magic while Viridius telepathically quizz es them on ecological impact assessments.
- **Philosophy**: “Travel lightly, leave balance.” He insists explorers become stewards, not conquerors, of the realms they traverse.
- **Faith Alignment**: Devotee of the Verdant Confluence, a planar druidic circle that tends the seams between worlds.
- **Combat Style**: Manipulates verdant winds and corrosive spores to repel invaders while sealing breaches with living root barriers.
- **Signature Move**: *Genesis Gale*—Viridius exhales a torrent of seeds and emerald vapor that sprouts instant foliage, slowing enemies and restoring allies with planar pollen.
- “Every plane watches how you tread its soil.”
- “Balance is not a suggestion; it is survival.”
- “Catalog the smallest sprout—it might be the keystone of a world.”
- Viridius requests escorts on a survey of the Ooze Plane where invasive fungus threatens a portal to the campus arboretum.
- A planar bloom overruns the conservatory; he needs brave students to prune the runaway ecology without collapsing the research.
- He hires the party to negotiate with a council of fey whose realm is being poisoned by careless planar miners.
- He hires the party to negotiate with a council of fey whose realm is being poisoned by careless planar miners.
