### Viridius

Ancient Green Dragon

### Role

Professor of **Planar Studies**

**College**: Quintessence Institute

**Major**: Planar Studies

### Personality

Grounded, wry, and fiercely protective of the living. Viridius delights in practical fieldcraft and expects students to respect ecosystems before theorizing about them.

### Description

Deep-green scales veined with mossy filaments; leaves sometimes sprout in his wake and crumble into planar dust. His breath smells of rain on stone.

### Background

He served as a ward-steward along faultlines where lower planes seep into forests and deltas, documenting how biomes adapt—or fail—to planar stress. He teaches mitigation over conquest.

### Classes Taught

- **PLAN 111 – Lower Planar Explorations**

### Academic Approach

- **Course Focus**: Field assessment of hostile planar edges, remediation rituals, and diplomacy with native spirits.
- **Teaching Style**: Boots-muddy practicums; students must submit habitat impact statements with every assignment.
- **Philosophy**: “Balance is negotiated, not imposed.”

### Faith and Combat Prowess

- **Faith Alignment**: Pact of the Verdant Boundary—pledges to intercede when realms poison life.
- **Combat Style**: Binding roots and choking mists that corral rather than slaughter.
- **Signature Move**: Green Wall Accord—raises a living barrier that drinks infernal smog and undead chill.

### Classroom & Teaching Environment

Open-air terrace garden layered with planar microclimates in warded boxes; weather vanes twitch when breaches nearby surge.

### Quotes

- “If a cure kills the forest, it wasn’t a cure.”
- “Map the wound, then ask who it serves.”
- “Life is stubborn—help it be.”

### Encounter Ideas

- Stabilize a village at the edge of a hellblight while a baron refuses to evacuate.
- Broker a truce with ash mephits whose nest sits atop a potable spring.
- Replant a grove whose roots were cut by a planar contraband pipeline.
