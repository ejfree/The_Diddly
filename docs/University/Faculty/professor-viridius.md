### Background

Professor Viridius is a distinguished scholar known for his expertise in the ecological and environmental aspects of various planes of existence. His research primarily focuses on how different environments affect both flora and fauna across the planes, emphasizing the interconnectivity and ecological balance necessary for sustaining life.

## Courses Taught

- **PLAN 111 – Lower Planar Explorations**

### Academic Approach

- **Course Focus**: Viridius studies how planar ecosystems intersect, charting food webs, elemental weather patterns, and restorative rituals that keep portals from destabilizing.
- **Teaching Style**: Fieldwork is mandatory—students collect samples with carefully rationed magic while Viridius telepathically quizz es them on ecological impact assessments.
- **Philosophy**: “Travel lightly, leave balance.” He insists explorers become stewards, not conquerors, of the realms they traverse.

### Faith and Combat Prowess

- **Faith Alignment**: Devotee of the Verdant Confluence, a planar druidic circle that tends the seams between worlds.
- **Combat Style**: Manipulates verdant winds and corrosive spores to repel invaders while sealing breaches with living root barriers.
- **Signature Move**: *Genesis Gale*—Viridius exhales a torrent of seeds and emerald vapor that sprouts instant foliage, slowing enemies and restoring allies with planar pollen.

### Classroom & Teaching Environment

Lectures convene in the Planisphere Conservatory, a greenhouse threaded with miniature biomes from every plane he has catalogued. Students rotate between observation decks, each tuned to a different planar atmosphere, while enchanted vines record their field notes in chlorophyll ink.

### Quotes

- “Every plane watches how you tread its soil.”
- “Balance is not a suggestion; it is survival.”
- “Catalog the smallest sprout—it might be the keystone of a world.”

### Encounter Ideas

- Viridius requests escorts on a survey of the Ooze Plane where invasive fungus threatens a portal to the campus arboretum.
- A planar bloom overruns the conservatory; he needs brave students to prune the runaway ecology without collapsing the research.
- He hires the party to negotiate with a council of fey whose realm is being poisoned by careless planar miners.
