## Professor Nyxithar

Ancient Doom Dragon

### Role

Professor of **Prophecy**

**College**: College of Lore

**Major**: Prophecy

### Personality

Grimly compassionate and disarmingly calm. Nyxithar teaches students to read catastrophe so they can refuse to worship it.

### Description

Void-dark scales with cracks of ember-glow beneath; when she blinks, the room grows briefly quieter, as if bracing.

### Background

Once a herald of endings for cities that would not change, she laid down the mantle after saving one. Now she trains interpreters to turn omens into exits.

### Classes Taught

- **PROF 240 – Threads of Doom: Cataclysmic Visions in Prophetic Weave**

### Academic Approach

- **Course Focus**: Cataclysm signals, tipping-point mapping, and designing graceful failure paths.
- **Teaching Style**: Scenario labs, drills in uncertainty, and grief-aware facilitation.
- **Philosophy**: We are not here to predict doom; we are here to survive it together.

### Faith and Combat Prowess

- **Faith Alignment**: Witness of the Last Light—honors those who choose to live in the gap between warning and harm.
- **Combat Style**: Doom-lull fields that slow escalation and open retreats.
- **Signature Move**: Thread Sever—cuts the one strand that triggers a cascade.

### Classroom & Teaching Environment

Dim lecture hall with evacuation maps on every wall and a ritual for naming what each student fears before they begin.

### Quotes

- "An ending foretold is an invitation to act."
- "Name the failure you can live with."
- "Do not kneel to inevitability."

### Encounter Ideas

- Defang a prophecy cult by designing a better future in public.
- Guide an exodus through a city built to trap its people.
- Break a doom loop powered by grief.
