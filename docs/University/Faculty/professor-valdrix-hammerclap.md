### Valdrix Hammerclap

Ancient Cerulean Dragon

### Role

Professor of **Mineral Extraction & Refinement**

**College**: School of Yield Surging

**Major**: Mineral Extraction & Refinement

### Personality

Blunt, boisterous, and tirelessly protective of crews. Valdrix measures success in uneventful shifts and zero missing fingers.

### Description

Sea-cerulean scales with tide-mark striations; brine beads on his horns. His tail thumps like a winch when he’s pleased.

### Background

Raised in pelagic mines, he engineered low-visibility extraction rigs that spared divers’ lives. He came ashore to end the habit of treating workers as ballast.

### Classes Taught

- **MINX 220 – Extraction Tools: Breath and Steel**



### Academic Approach

- **Course Focus**: Underwater extraction, pressure safety, desalination byproducts, and salvage ethics.
- **Teaching Style**: Wet-bay practicums, buddy checks, and failure drills in blackout tanks.
- **Philosophy**: If the sea must give, give back twice.

### Faith and Combat Prowess

- **Faith Alignment**: Tidekeeper’s Oath—stewardship of waters worked and traveled.
- **Combat Style**: Pressure waves that shove danger off fragile supports; vortex shields around noncombatants.
- **Signature Move**: Hammerclap Surge—overpressure slam that collapses a threat while stabilizing nearby structures.

### Classroom & Teaching Environment

Submerged training bay with adjustable currents and a gantry of breathing charms and ballast runes.

### Quotes

- "No vein is worth a wake."
- "Check your buddy; then check again."
- "The ocean remembers disrespect."

### Encounter Ideas

- Drain a flooded shaft without collapsing the reef above it.
- Rescue trapped divers as a storm churns the bay.
- Thwart a dredger crew ignoring sacred migration paths.
