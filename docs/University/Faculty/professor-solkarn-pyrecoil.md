### Solkarn Pyrecoil

Ancient Red Dragon

### Role

Professor of **Elemental Binding**

**College**: Academy of Archano-Elemental and Techno Mechanics

**Major**: Elemental Binding

### Personality

Volcanic confidence tempered by discipline. Solkarn respects fire by never begging it to behave.

### Description

Red scales veined with glow; heat haze dances above his shoulders.

### Background

He shut down a prestigious combustor line after one fatality and rewrote the safety doctrine. Students call him ‘the brakes’ and mean it lovingly.

### Classes Taught

- **ELBD 212 – Firebound Constructs and Combustion Spirits**



### Academic Approach

- **Course Focus**: Fire spirits, controlled burn engines, and fail-quiet designs.
- **Teaching Style**: Burn tables, cooldown rituals, and stop-tests.
- **Philosophy**: Passion needs guardrails.

### Faith and Combat Prowess

- **Faith Alignment**: Ember Mercy—heat for hearth, not harm.
- **Combat Style**: Heat sinks and flame herders that pen danger away.
- **Signature Move**: Pyrecoil Clamp—pinches a blaze into a tame pilot light.

### Classroom & Teaching Environment

Fire bay with glass shields, heat gauges, and a big red stop cord.

### Quotes

- "If it scares you, good—respect that."
- "Cool down; think sharper."
- "We build for the worst minute."

### Encounter Ideas

- Contain a factory blaze without water.
- Convince a fire elemental to relocate willingly.
- Disarm a revenge arson with a warm meal and a job.
