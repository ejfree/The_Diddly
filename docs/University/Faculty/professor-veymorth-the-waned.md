### Professor Veymorth the Waned

Ancient Doom Dragon

### Role

Professor of **Prophecy**

**College**: College of Lore

**Major**: Prophecy

### Personality

Veymorth is enigmatic and unsettling, with a distant demeanor that speaks to his constant mental bombardment by futures yet unlived. He is contemplative and eerily calm, prone to lapsing into silences mid-sentence as he sorts through the tides of prophecy that crash against his mind. Students describe him as simultaneously intimidating and strangely comforting—like the eye of a storm. He has little patience for trivial conversation, yet shows unexpected empathy when a student is truly struggling to grasp the existential weight of their studies.

### Description

Veymorth’s scales are a dull, ashen white, streaked with smoky grays and the occasional flicker of violet when prophecy surges through him. His massive wings seem more spectral than solid, and his eyes hold an unnatural stillness—as if he’s always staring through time. Horns curve back like crumbled crescent moons, and strange runic scars spiral down his chest and tail, etched during ancient rituals of foresight. When he speaks, his voice echoes with a strange delay, like it's chasing itself across timelines.

### Background

Veymorth once served as oracle to a doomed empire, forced to watch every warning he uttered dismissed until catastrophe struck. He abandoned courtly prophecy and sought refuge at the Diddly, where he now teaches dragons to bear the psychological weight of endless futures. Rumor holds he carries a reliquary of discarded timelines, occasionally consulting them when confronted with paradox.

### Classes Taught

- **PROF 271 – Bearing the Storm: Mental Resilience for Seers**
- **PROF 286 – Paradox Management and Ethical Non-Action**

### Academic Approach

* **Course Focus**: Veymorth's courses explore the limits of prophetic magic, focusing on the mental toll of divination and the collapse of time-consistency within powerful draconic minds. Students learn to interpret fractured visions and trace threads of causality through the Infinite Coil.

* **Teaching Style**: Seminar-based with extended periods of guided trance meditation, vision quests, and collaborative prophetic reconstructions. He requires high participation and often grades based on comprehension of *unspoken*patterns in omens.

* **Philosophy**: "Prophecy is not a roadmap, but a storm. You do not follow it—you survive it."

### Faith and Combat Prowess

* **Prophet of the Pale Tapestry**: Veymorth’s fractured mind aligns with Pharasma, though he rarely acknowledges deities. He believes prophecy is a consequence of fate, not a gift. He views the Pale Tapestry as an unraveling weave, and he teaches his students to find meaning in the fray.

* **Combat Style**: Veymorth fights rarely, but with terrifying effectiveness. His mental breath weapon disorients and overwhelms, breaking enemies' minds with glimpses of infinite futures. He uses occult curses and fate-bending reactions to undo actions before they occur.

* **Signature Move**: *Collapse of Certainty* – An area attack that forces creatures to relive all possible outcomes of a failed decision, stunning them and forcing Will saves against their own future selves.

### Classroom & Teaching Environment

Veymorth teaches deep within the Atheneum Prime, in a subchamber known as *The Whisper Vault*. The space is shielded by layers of silent stone and divinatory dampeners, yet even here, stray visions slip through. The ceiling appears to be an endless sky of swirling constellations that change unpredictably. Stone seats hover in a slow orbit around a circular scrying pool in the floor. Students are provided headache suppressants and grounding sigils upon entry.

### Quotes

* “The future is not what happens. It is what *might refuse* to happen.”

* “Do not seek clarity. Seek strength enough to bear the unknown.”

* “Prophecy is not about being *right*. It is about being *ready*.”

* “My breath will not scorch your flesh—it will *undo your certainty*.”

### Encounter Ideas

* **Office Hours Gone Awry**: A student overdoses on temporal meditation and begins unraveling in time; Veymorth requests the adventurers escort the student's consciousness back through prophetic visions.

* **Shattered Future**: An echo of Veymorth from a divergent timeline appears with knowledge of an apocalyptic event; players must help him and Veymorth reconcile their timelines.

* **Mental Duel**: During a lecture, a rival mind-prophet breaches the Whisper Vault to challenge Veymorth; the players are caught in a psychic battlefield where reality distorts and thoughts become monsters.

* **Field Mission**: Veymorth sends students (and adventurers) to retrieve a lost draconic omen buried within an ancient ruin that phases between futures.
