### Threnaxis Foldscale

Ancient Green Dragon

### Role

Professor of **Planar Studies**

**College**: Quintessence Institute

**Major**: Planar Studies

### Personality

Sober, strategic, and stubbornly hopeful. Threnaxis treats breaches like infections: isolate, heal, and immunize.

### Description

Green scales with seam-lines that suggest folded maps; his eyes triangulate while he listens.

### Background

He sealed a chain of micro-breaches by enlisting local spirits as guardians, then codified the practice.

### Classes Taught

- **PLAN 257 – Anchors and Breaches: Sealing Planar Incursions**

### Academic Approach

- **Course Focus**: Breach ecology, anchor ethics, and post-closure stewardship.
- **Teaching Style**: Field surveys, anchor crafting, and community drills.
- **Philosophy**: Close the door; check the windows.

### Faith and Combat Prowess

- **Faith Alignment**: Stewards of the Fold—keep the edges kind.
- **Combat Style**: Root-wards and fold-snaps that stitch seams.
- **Signature Move**: Foldscale Seal—laces a breach with living anchors.

### Classroom & Teaching Environment

War-room with seam maps, anchor kits, and a model breach that leaks on purpose.

### Quotes

- "A sealed wound still needs care."
- "Anchors are promises to neighbors."
- "Fix it with them, not to them."

### Encounter Ideas

- Close a breach that learned to move.
- Retrain a village to live beside a seam safely.
- Replace a corrupted anchor without collapse.
