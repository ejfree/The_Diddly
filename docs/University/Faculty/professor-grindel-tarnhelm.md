### Grindel Tarnhelm

Ancient Red Dragon

### Role

Professor of **Arcanomechanics**

**College**: Academy of Archano-Elemental and Techno Mechanics

**Major**: Arcanomechanics

### Personality

Blaze-bright pride tempered by engineer’s patience. Grindel rewards rugged designs that protect the wearer first.

### Description

Red enamel scales with heat-dimples; a collar of overlapping plates clicks when he turns.

### Background

Veteran of vanguard work where armor decided who came home, he shifted to research after a near-fatal mesh failure he refuses to see repeated.

### Classes Taught

- **AMCH 221 – Reactive Armor and Spellmesh Integration**



### Academic Approach

- **Course Focus**: Reactive laminates, spellmesh interoperability, and field-repair doctrine.
- **Teaching Style**: Live-fire tests with strict safety cordons; iterative improvements logged between runs.
- **Philosophy**: Armor is a promise, not a costume.

### Faith and Combat Prowess

- **Faith Alignment**: Ember Guard—sworn to interpose before ignite.
- **Combat Style**: Heat blooms that draw fire to himself and into ablative fields.
- **Signature Move**: Tarnhelm Rampart—projects a mobile bulwark that drinks spellforce.

### Classroom & Teaching Environment

Test yard with impact rigs, rune cannons, and benches stacked with replacement parts.

### Quotes

- "If it looks heroic, it probably isn’t finished."
- "Protect first, impress never."
- "Repair kits save lives—capstones save egos."

### Encounter Ideas

- Shore up a militia with emergency refits before a siege.
- Diagnose armor sabotage at a tournament.
- Field-test a shield against dragonfire safely.
