### Yelva Shalecloak

Ancient Gold Dragon

### Role

Professor of **Mineral Extraction & Refinement**

**College**: School of Yield Surging

**Major**: Mineral Extraction & Refinement

### Personality

Principled, even-tempered, and uncompromising on safety. Yelva values clear checklists, honest ledgers, and crews who look after one another. She believes profit without stewardship is collapse deferred.

### Description

Matte gold scales dusted with flecks like embedded ore; heat-haze shimmers from the vents along her plates. Her talons are blunt from work, not display, and a braided cable of sigil-thread hangs at her throat like a miner’s tag.

### Background

Once an imperial inspector of royal mines, Yelva resigned after exposing quotas that gambled with lives. She now trains engineers to read stone as language and to design operations that leave mountains standing and people whole.

### Classes Taught

- **MINX 241 – Collapse Scenarios and Structural Fortification**



### Academic Approach

- **Course Focus**: Load paths, fault prediction, refuge engineering, and ethical refining that minimizes toxic tailings.
- **Teaching Style**: Drill-first; collapse simulators, red-tag walkthroughs, and rotating foreperson roles for accountability.
- **Philosophy**: Wealth worth keeping never buries the hands that found it.

### Faith and Combat Prowess

- **Faith Alignment**: Oath of Stewardship—vows to hold the line where greed meets ground.
- **Combat Style**: Radiant bulwarks and controlled quakes to pin threats away from workers and supports.
- **Signature Move**: Veinlock Ward—stabilizes a failing chamber and seals fracture propagation with golden lattice.

### Classroom & Teaching Environment

A terraced cavern theater wrapped around a rockfall simulator; lantern runes track stress in real time while students call out brace orders.

### Quotes

- "Stone speaks in warnings—listen before it shouts."
- "Count lives before yields."
- "If your plan can’t survive a drill, it won’t survive a shift."

### Encounter Ideas

- Reinforce a sabotaged lift before trapped miners run out of air.
- Negotiate a ceasework with a baron who refuses to halt blasting over an active fault.
- Escort a convoy of refined reagents through a landslide corridor while stabilizing the route.
