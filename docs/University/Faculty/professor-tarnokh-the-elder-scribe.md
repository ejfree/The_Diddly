## Professor Tarnokh the Elder Scribe

Ancient Brass Dragon

### Role

Professor of **History**

**College**: College of Lore

**Major**: History

### Personality

Genial, encyclopedic, and stubborn about primary sources. Tarnokh rewards curiosity tempered by citation.

### Description

Brass scales polished by dust and time; spectacles perch on a muzzle that smiles more than it scowls. His wings smell faintly of vellum and lamp oil.

### Background

Once a traveling biographer of dragons who walked among mortals, he learned how memory warps with retelling. He founded a living archive to capture voices before the legend ossifies.

### Classes Taught

- **HIST 214 – The Wyrms Who Walked: Biographies of Legendary Dragons**

### Academic Approach

- **Course Focus**: Biography as history, oral testimony, and separating mythic motifs from documented deeds.
- **Teaching Style**: Interview practicums, corroboration drills, and annotated timelines.
- **Philosophy**: Lives are stories—tell them true.

### Faith and Combat Prowess

- **Faith Alignment**: Keeper of the Scribed Breath—vows to preserve last words and first truths.
- **Combat Style**: Sonic declarations that still crowds while sparing the fragile.
- **Signature Move**: Edict of Recall—forces a target to confront its own record, breaking glamours and false boasts.

### Classroom & Teaching Environment

A salon-library with rolling ladders, interview alcoves, and a globe of known draconic migrations.

### Quotes

- "A good question is a gift."
- "Footnotes are bridges between strangers."
- "Truth doesn’t need polish—just light."

### Encounter Ideas

- Take testimony from a dying wyrm whose tale will start a war if misheard.
- Recover a stolen biography draft before it’s ‘improved’.
- Moderate a feud between two legends whose memories contradict.
