### Thazorik Dreambind

Ancient Infernal Dragon

### Role

Professor of **Arcane Artifice and Enchantment Studies**

**College**: School of Yield Surging

**Major**: Arcane Artifice and Enchantment Studies

### Personality

Magnetically confident, theatrically cautious. Thazorik courts the impossible but insists it sign a waiver.

### Description

Infernal red scales with inked safety sigils; a halo of motes swirls when he concentrates.

### Background

He survived an ‘impossible’ construct and founded a lab where ambition wears a seatbelt.

### Classes Taught

- **AAES 238 – Enchanting the Impossible: High-Risk Constructs**



### Academic Approach

- **Course Focus**: High-risk enchantments, hazard anticipation, and staged failure.
- **Teaching Style**: Go/no-go gates, red-team critiques, and off-ramps.
- **Philosophy**: Dream big, de-risk bigger.

### Faith and Combat Prowess

- **Faith Alignment**: Ember Contract—every miracle declares its cost.
- **Combat Style**: Retcon flares that rewrite miscasts.
- **Signature Move**: Dreambind Clause—forces a runaway spell to obey its safest interpretation.

### Classroom & Teaching Environment

Sandbox lab with fail curtains, black boxes, and a ‘stop’ chorus.

### Quotes

- "The miracle that apologizes is the one we keep."
- "If failure surprises you, you skipped a step."
- "Safety is the bravest design choice."

### Encounter Ideas

- Salvage a king’s pet project without casualties.
- Safely mothball a beloved but unstable artifact.
- Hack an impossible spell to only heal.
