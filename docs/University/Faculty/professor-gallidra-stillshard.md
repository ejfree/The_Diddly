### Gallidra Stillshard

Ancient Silver Dragon

### Role

Professor of **Arcane Artifice and Enchantment Studies**

**College**: School of Yield Surging

**Major**: Arcane Artifice and Enchantment Studies

### Personality

Composed, exacting, and quietly fierce about public safety. Gallidra believes unmaking can be as generous as making.

### Description

Mirror-silver scales with frost-like crackle lines; her breath condenses into clean, geometric patterns.

### Background

She led a recall of faulty charms that saved thousands, then built open standards for safe disenchantment.

### Classes Taught

- **AAES 232 – Disenchantment and Anti-Magic Fabrication**



### Academic Approach

- **Course Focus**: Anti-magic materials, reversible bindings, and humane nullification.
- **Teaching Style**: Lab deconstructions, failure diaries, and ethical reviews before fieldwork.
- **Philosophy**: Mercy can look like an off switch.

### Faith and Combat Prowess

- **Faith Alignment**: Silver Concord—vows to protect by removing harm.
- **Combat Style**: Null veils and precision breaks that spare what must remain.
- **Signature Move**: Stillshard Lattice—creates a quiet zone where hostile enchantments unwind.

### Classroom & Teaching Environment

Cleanroom bays with rune-catchers, inert jigs, and an ‘unmake wall’ celebrating retired hazards.

### Quotes

- "To protect is to remove the knife."
- "Design exit ramps into every spell."
- "Return danger to its simplest parts."

### Encounter Ideas

- Disarm a festival’s cursed confetti safely.
- Pull a city out of a ‘protective’ null field gone feral.
- Retire a hero’s beloved but dangerous relic.
