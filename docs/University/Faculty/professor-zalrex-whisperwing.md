### Zalrex Whisperwing

Ancient Silver Dragon

### Role

Professor of **Political Intrigue and Diplomacy**

**College**: Quintessence Institute

**Major**: Political Intrigue and Diplomacy

### Personality

Measured, empathetic, and unflinchingly principled. Zalrex teaches that mercy and leverage are not opposites and that lasting victories are signed in quiet rooms, not on battlefields.

### Description

Polished silver scales catch the light like heraldic steel; a soft frost follows his breath when he is disappointed. His eyes hold a diplomat’s patience and a sentinel’s watchfulness.

### Background

A former truce-architect between rival skyholds, Zalrex codified ceasefires that outlived their rulers. He joined the Institute to formalize soft-power doctrine and train mediators who can survive intrigue without staining their honor.

### Classes Taught

- **POLI 237 – Subtle Warfare: Sanction, Subterfuge, and Soft Power**



### Academic Approach

- **Course Focus**: Sanctions, coalition-building, intelligence validation, and counter-subterfuge that minimizes collateral harm.
- **Teaching Style**: Tabletop negotiations, red/blue intrigue simulations, and after-action ethics reviews.
- **Philosophy**: Strength is credibility wielded with restraint.

### Faith and Combat Prowess

- **Faith Alignment**: Oath of the Silver Concord—promises kept in public and private alike.
- **Combat Style**: Disarming wards and binding oaths mid-combat to halt escalations.
- **Signature Move**: Accord Seal—freezes aggressors who violate declared terms, forcing a pause for parley.

### Classroom & Teaching Environment

A circular forum with mirrored galleries for observers; soundwards ensure candid debate without eavesdropping.

### Quotes

- "Win the room, spare the realm."
- "A blade cuts once; a promise cuts forever."
- "Listen for the concession they want to make."

### Encounter Ideas

- Broker a ceasefire before a famine turns border raids into massacres.
- Unmask a forged treaty clause inserted to sabotage peace.
- Escort a whistleblower diplomat through a hostile gala.
