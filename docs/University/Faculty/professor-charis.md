Professor Charris is an infernal dragon with a formidable presence, her dull red scales reflecting her lineage of tyrannical deal brokers. Her appearance is more devilish than that of typical dragons, with sharp, angular features, a pair of menacing horns curving back from her forehead, and eyes that burn with a smoldering intensity. Her breath weapon is a powerful stream of fire, capable of incinerating anything in its path, a testament to her fiery nature and her mastery over the destructive elements.

She teaches *Eldritch Fundamentals - Eldritch Engineering 199* at the Chthonic Nexus, a foreboding structure deep within the heart of Dragon University, known for its labyrinthine corridors and eerie atmosphere. The course itself delves into the dark and mysterious aspects of arcane engineering, focusing on the creation and manipulation of eldritch devices and artifacts that harness otherworldly energies. Professor Charris's teaching style is as intense as her appearance, demanding precision and a deep understanding of the esoteric principles that govern eldritch mechanics. Her students are often pushed to their limits, but those who excel under her tutelage emerge as some of the most skilled and feared engineers in the realm.

### Appearance
Professor Charris is an imposing figure, her infernal heritage evident in every aspect of her appearance. Her scales are a dull, almost matte red, lacking the shine of more vibrant dragons but instead exuding a menacing aura. Her face is distinctly devilish, with sharp, angular features that give her an air of unyielding authority. Two large, black horns curve back from her forehead, their tips slightly charred from the intense heat that radiates from her body. Her eyes are a deep, burning ember, glowing with an inner fire that never dims. Her wings are massive, with dark, leathery membranes that ripple with a subtle heat, and her long, whip-like tail ends in a barbed point, further enhancing her fearsome appearance. She often wears intricately crafted armor that is both functional and ceremonial, adorned with runes that seem to pulse with a sinister energy.

### Powers & Abilities
As an infernal dragon, Professor Charris possesses a number of potent abilities that reflect her fiery nature and her deep connection to infernal powers:

- **Fire Breath:** Charris can unleash a torrent of searing flames from her maw, capable of incinerating anything caught in its path. This breath weapon is as destructive as it is precise, with Charris able to control its intensity and spread.

- **Infernal Deal-Making:** Descended from a line of tyrannical deal brokers, Charris has inherited the ability to strike infernal pacts with other beings. These deals often come at a steep price, but they can grant incredible power or knowledge to those willing to pay.

- **Eldritch Engineering Mastery:** Charris is a master of eldritch mechanics, able to create, manipulate, and destroy devices and artifacts that draw upon otherworldly energies. Her expertise in this field makes her one of the most knowledgeable and feared engineers in the realm.

- **Aura of Domination:** Charris exudes an aura of intimidation and dominance, making it difficult for others to resist her commands or challenge her authority. This aura can cause lesser beings to cower or submit in her presence.

- **Hellfire Resistance:** Her infernal heritage grants her near-immunity to fire and heat-based attacks, making her incredibly resilient in combat, especially against fire-wielding foes.

### Personality and Demeanor
Professor Charris is as fiery in personality as she is in appearance. She is fiercely intelligent, with a sharp mind honed by centuries of study and practice in eldritch engineering and infernal deal-making. Her demeanor is stern and unyielding, with little patience for incompetence or failure. She demands excellence from her students and peers alike, and those who fall short of her expectations are often met with her scathing disdain.

Despite her harsh exterior, Charris is not without a sense of fairness. She respects those who prove themselves capable and driven, and she is known to offer guidance—albeit in her own brusque manner—to those who show potential. However, her respect is hard-earned, and her approval even more so.

Charris's interactions are often tinged with a sense of calculation, as she is always assessing the potential benefits and risks of any situation. She is a shrewd negotiator, capable of turning even the most disadvantageous circumstances to her favor. Her students often describe her as intimidating but effective, and those who survive her rigorous training emerge as formidable engineers and deal-makers in their own right.

In her quieter moments, Charris is contemplative, often found studying ancient texts or refining her eldritch devices in solitude. Her love for knowledge and power is evident in all she does, and she is always on the lookout for ways to expand her understanding of the dark and arcane.

Professor Charris is an infernal dragon, descended from a line of tyrannical deal brokers. She breathes fire. Infernal dragons have dull red scales and more devilish look to their face. She teaches Elderich Fundamentals - Elderich Engineering 199, which is located in the Cthonic Nexus.
