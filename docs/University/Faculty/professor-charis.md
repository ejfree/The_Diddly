### Professor Charris Emberfiend

Ancient Infernal Dragon

### Role

Professor of **Eldritch Engineering**

**College**: Academy of Archano-elemental and Techno Mechanics

**Major**: Eldritch Engineering

### Personality

Professor Charris is as fiery in personality as she is in appearance. She is fiercely intelligent, with a sharp mind honed by centuries of study and practice in eldritch engineering and infernal deal-making. Her demeanor is stern and unyielding, with little patience for incompetence or failure. She demands excellence from her students and peers alike, and those who fall short of her expectations are often met with her scathing disdain.

### Description

Professor Charris is an imposing figure, her infernal heritage evident in every aspect of her appearance. Her scales are a dull, almost matte red, lacking the shine of more vibrant dragons but instead exuding a menacing aura. Her face is distinctly devilish, with sharp, angular features that give her an air of unyielding authority. Two large, black horns curve back from her forehead, their tips slightly charred from the intense heat that radiates from her body. Her eyes are a deep, burning ember, glowing with an inner fire that never dims. Her wings are massive, with dark, leathery membranes that ripple with a subtle heat, and her long, whip-like tail ends in a barbed point, further enhancing her fearsome appearance. She often wears intricately crafted armor that is both functional and ceremonial, adorned with runes that seem to pulse with a sinister energy.

### Background

Born into a lineage of infernal engineers who bargained with devils for blueprints of impossible machines, Charis defected from her clan after realizing every contract cost a soul. She now channels that same ruthless precision into outwitting fiends and reclaiming weapons they seeded across the planes. Her personal project, the Emberlock Engine, is rumored to seal planar breaches by siphoning the promise of a pact before it is signed.

### Classes Taught

- **[Eldritch Fundamentals](../Academics/course-catalog.md#eldritch-fundamentals)**

### Academic Approach

- **Course Focus**: Charis dismantles forbidden artifacts alongside her students, revealing how each sigil interacts with blood, intention, and mechanical leverage.
- **Teaching Style**: Professor Charris's teaching style is as intense as her appearance, demanding precision and a deep understanding of the esoteric principles that govern eldritch mechanics. Her students are often pushed to their limits, but those who excel under her tutelage emerge as some of the most skilled and feared engineers in the realm.
- **Philosophy**: In her quieter moments, Charris is contemplative, often found studying ancient texts or refining her eldritch devices in solitude. Her love for knowledge and power is evident in all she does, and she is always on the lookout for ways to expand her understanding of the dark and arcane.

### Faith and Combat Prowess

- **Faith Alignment**: Votary of the Ember Ledger, a splinter sect devoted to breaking infernal contracts and freeing bound inventors.
- **Combat Style**:
  - **Aura of Domination:** Charris exudes an aura of intimidation and dominance, making it difficult for others to resist her commands or challenge her authority. This aura can cause lesser beings to cower or submit in her presence.

  - **Hellfire Resistance:** Her infernal heritage grants her near-immunity to fire and heat-based attacks, making her incredibly resilient in combat, especially against fire-wielding foes.
- **Signature Move**: *Hellchain Reversal*—Charis lashes a barbed chain of molten runes that latches onto an enemy spell, siphons its power, and reconstitutes it as a protective ward around her allies.

### Classroom & Teaching Environment

Charis’ lecture hall, the Crucible Annex, resembles a forge more than a classroom. Brass gantries rotate overhead with suspended artifacts, while containment sigils flicker beneath every workstation. Students are issued warded gauntlets before entering and must inscribe a counter-hex upon the doorframe when they leave—a ritual she uses to ensure they retain what they learned.

### Quotes

- “Power unexamined is power already stolen.”
- “If you cannot take it apart, you do not deserve to wield it.”
- “A contract is just a machine made of words—break the gear that matters.”

### Encounter Ideas

- Charis recruits the heroes to retrieve schematics she once forged for a devil prince before they are auctioned to cultists.
- A student’s project goes rogue, binding itself to the academy’s heating furnaces; Charis needs muscle while she traces the errant pact runes.
- The Ember Ledger calls in a favor, asking Charis to liberate a village enslaved by cursed machinery—she sends the party ahead to disable the devices so she can cleanse the contracts.
