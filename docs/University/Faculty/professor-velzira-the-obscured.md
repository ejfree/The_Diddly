### Velzira the Obscured

Ancient Green Dragon

### Role

Professor of **Prophecy**

**College**: College of Lore

**Major**: Prophecy

### Personality

Patient, sly, and fond of letting students discover what she already knows. Velzira values clarity over certainty and warns that prophecy without language is a trap.

### Description

Forest-green scales veined with scriptlike patterns; a haze of pollen-sweet scent clings to her. Her tongue flicks as if tasting grammar in the air.

### Background

Velzira grew up among oral traditions that hid prophecies in folktales. She later recovered fragments of dead tongues and proved how mistranslation had birthed false dooms. She now trains interpreters rather than oracles.

### Classes Taught

- **PROF 245 – Voice of the Ancients: Translating Lost Prophetic Tongues**



### Academic Approach

- **Course Focus**: Lost prophetic languages, semantic drift, and reconstruction from parallel texts and rites.
- **Teaching Style**: Translation studios with staged errors; students must document uncertainty and propose revisions.
- **Philosophy**: Words shape futures—choose them with care.

### Faith and Combat Prowess

- **Faith Alignment**: Keeper of the Green Lexicon—vows to preserve meaning against decay.
- **Combat Style**: Entangling verses that root enemies while loosening lies.
- **Signature Move**: Gloss of Truth—imposes a shared vocabulary that strips ambiguity from hostile magic.

### Classroom & Teaching Environment

A scriptorium-grove: living trunks bear bark-scripts, and wind-chimes sound phonemes of forgotten alphabets.

### Quotes

- "The wrong word can doom a city."
- "Translate the speaker, not just the speech."
- "Ambiguity is a predator—spot it early."

### Encounter Ideas

- Recover a lexeme-stone from smugglers before a cult recasts an omen.
- Mediate between two sects divided by a single mistranslated vow.
- Field-test a living glossary in a ruin whose walls reply.
