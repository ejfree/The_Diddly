Practical, warm, and community-first. Klarna teaches extraction as stewardship and budgeting as a survival spell.

Brass scales dulled by honest work; her back creaks like gravel when she stretches.

She organized burrow co-ops that survived famine by sharing veins and knowledge. She came to scale those lessons.

- **Philosophy**: A mine is a neighborhood.

### Faith and Combat Prowess

- **Faith Alignment**: Hearth Compact—protect the hands that dig.
- **Combat Style**: Deflection dust and echo calls to rally allies.
- **Signature Move**: Pebblebind Net—locks debris into a safe shell around civilians.

### Classroom & Teaching Environment

Tiered pit with ore mockups, contract tables, and a safety siren students must not ignore.

### Quotes

- "Your hoard is the people beside you."
- "Wealth that leaves, leaves holes."
- "Count hands, then coins."
