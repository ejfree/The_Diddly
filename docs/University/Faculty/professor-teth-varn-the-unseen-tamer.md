### Teth’Varn the Unseen Tamer

Ancient Brass Dragon

### Role

Professor of **Eldritch Engineering**

**College**: Academy of Archano-Elemental and Techno Mechanics

**Major**: Eldritch Engineering

### Personality

Cheerful, eerie, and endlessly cautious. Teth’Varn believes we can live with the things that once unmade us—on our terms.

### Description

Brass scales etched with control glyphs; an array of tuning forks hangs at his side.

### Background

He lost friends to madness-linked devices and spent decades building interlocks that listen for panic and power down.

### Classes Taught

- **ELEN 240 – Control Systems for Madness-Linked Devices**



### Academic Approach

- **Course Focus**: Feedback control for mind-linked tools, consent safeties, and remote overrides.
- **Teaching Style**: Paired pilots, panic-drill rehearsals, and calm design reviews.
- **Philosophy**: Nothing should need bravery to be safe.

### Faith and Combat Prowess

- **Faith Alignment**: Bellkeepers—ring before break.
- **Combat Style**: Damping fields that quiet frenzy.
- **Signature Move**: Unseen Tamer—names a device and it stands down.

### Classroom & Teaching Environment

Sim lab with heart monitors, override lanyards, and a bell you may always ring.

### Quotes

- "Design for panic."
- "A bell within reach is mercy."
- "Make madness boring."

### Encounter Ideas

- Disable a berserk siege harness without harming its wearer.
- Reclaim a lab overrun by feedback ghosts.
- Retrofit a festival’s thrill devices to be truly safe.
