### Dean Pyraxis the Flameheart

Ancient Red Dragon

### Role

Dean of **Elemental Binding**

**College**: Academy of Archano-elemental and Techno Mechanics

**Major**: Elemental Binding

### Personality

Pyraxis is known for his fiery temper which matches his elemental affinity, yet he is deeply respected for his unmatched knowledge in elemental binding techniques. He is stern but fair, always seeking to push his students beyond their limits while ensuring their safety and growth. Pyraxis values discipline and hard work, often seen as a demanding but inspiring figure among both faculty and students.

### Description

Pyraxis the Flameheart is a formidable red dragon whose scales shimmer like molten lava under the sunlight. With an imposing stature and wings that could eclipse the sun, Pyraxis exudes authority and ancient wisdom. His eyes, deep and fiery, seem to hold the secrets of elemental magic that few can fathom.

### Background

Born amidst the volcanic chains of the Draconic Highlands, Pyraxis was exposed to the primal forces of nature from a young age. His fascination with the elemental forces shaped his path, leading him to study at the Academy he now leads. Over centuries, Pyraxis has traveled extensively, gathering knowledge and artifacts that have furthered both his power and understanding of the elemental planes.

### Classes Taught

- Elemental Binding - Fundamentals to Mastery
- Firestorm Field Exercises
- Containment Strategies for Rogue Elementals

### Academic Approach

- **Course Focus**: Pyraxis blends theoretical bindings with hands-on containment drills, ensuring every student can negotiate with—and if necessary subdue—elementals across all four primary planes.
- **Teaching Style**: Lessons begin with intense sparring against conjured elementals, followed by debriefs where students diagram what went right and wrong while Pyraxis paces with a smoldering glare and incisive feedback.
- **Philosophy**: Power must be earned daily. He demands his dragons leave class both scorched and wiser, convinced that mastery over fire teaches restraint as much as dominance.

### Faith and Combat Prowess

- **Faith Alignment**: Pyraxis honors the Forge Crucible, a militant sect of brass and red dragons who see flame as the crucible of personal evolution.
- **Combat Style**:
  - **Elemental Command**: Pyraxis can manipulate fire and other elements with ease, weaving them into complex spells and enchantments.
  - He layers chains of superheated air that constrict foes before detonating them in controlled bursts to power his own wards.
- **Signature Move**: *Inferno Covenant*—Pyraxis brands an enemy with runes of binding fire; the mark siphons their elemental energy each time they attack, fueling his counterstrikes.

### Classroom & Teaching Environment

The Ember Crucible is a basalt arena ringed by ever-burning braziers. Magma sluices beneath glass panels, powering containment lattices that students adjust like organ stops. Safety wards flare in Pyraxis’s presence, but he expects pupils to set their own wards before every exercise.

### Quotes

- “If you leave a lesson un-singed, you learned nothing.”
- “Elementals respect only those who command themselves first.”
- “Heat tempers steel; adversity tempers dragons.”

### Encounter Ideas

- Pyraxis recruits the party to rescue a cohort trapped in the Plane of Fire after a field expedition meets a rogue efreeti warband.
- Saboteurs tamper with the academy’s containment runes; Pyraxis needs the heroes to catch the culprit before the crucible erupts.
- He tasks the adventurers with capturing a legendary ember elemental to power a new campus forge, promising rare binding sigils as payment.
