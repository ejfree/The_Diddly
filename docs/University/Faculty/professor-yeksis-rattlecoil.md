### Yeksis Rattlecoil

Ancient Crypt Dragon

### Role

Professor of **Ancient Relics and Artifacts**

**College**: College of Lore

**Major**: Ancient Relics and Artifacts

### Personality

Dry-witted, methodical, and morbidly charming. Yeksis values caution over bravado and insists every relic be treated as a witness, not a weapon.

### Description

Bone-pale scales threaded with funerary sigils; his breath smells of old parchment and myrrh. A necklace of broken trap glyphs clacks softly when he moves.

### Background

Once a tomb-warden who decommissioned predatory mausoleums, he cataloged curse architectures across cultures. He teaches safe recovery and ethical reinterment protocols to keep history from preying on the living.

### Classes Taught

- **ARAR 212 – Tomb Traps and Cursecraft**



### Academic Approach

- **Course Focus**: Curse taxonomy, trap logic, funerary context, and restorative containment.
- **Teaching Style**: Lab reconstructions of trap chains; students must simulate disarm sequences before fieldwork.
- **Philosophy**: Disturb nothing you cannot set right.

### Faith and Combat Prowess

- **Faith Alignment**: Steward of Quiet Doors—respect for endings that protect the living.
- **Combat Style**: Necrotic dampening and glyph scrubbing; turns weaponized grief inert.
- **Signature Move**: Ossuary Seal—locks hostile spirits behind a lattice of bone-light.

### Classroom & Teaching Environment

A dim reliquary lab with practice sarcophagi, inert curse matrices, and a memorial wall for unnamed dead Yeksis has reburied.

### Quotes

- "A relic remembers how it was taken. Ask politely."
- "Curiosity without consent is grave-robbing."
- "Reset the room before you leave it."

### Encounter Ideas

- Retrieve an heirloom from a family crypt whose curse changes with the thief’s intentions.
- Disarm a city-square monument that activates at dusk each solstice.
- Translate a lament that doubles as a kill-switch.
