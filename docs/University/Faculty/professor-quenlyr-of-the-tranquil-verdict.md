### Quenlyr of the Tranquil Verdict

Ancient Copper Dragon

### Role

Professor of **Planar Studies**

**College**: Quintessence Institute

**Major**: Planar Studies

### Personality

Dry-humored, unflappable, and judicious. Quenlyr hears every side before rendering an opinion and trains students to separate value claims from verifiable facts.

### Description

Polished copper plates engraved with tiny legal maxims; the edges of his frills ring softly like chimes when he nods. His eyes weigh like scales.

### Background

He served as an itinerant arbiter along contested borders of aligned planes, drafting accords that survived generational shifts in cosmology. He joined the Institute to formalize outer-realm jurisprudence.

### Classes Taught

- **PLAN 261 – Concords and Conflicts of the Outer Realms**



### Academic Approach

- **Course Focus**: Comparative planar law, treaty mechanics, and enforcement without occupation.
- **Teaching Style**: Moot courts and negotiation labs; students alternate roles as envoys, adjudicators, and impacted locals.
- **Philosophy**: “Peace is procedural—and precious for it.”

### Faith and Combat Prowess

- **Faith Alignment**: The Tranquil Verdict—oath to bind conflict to words before wounds.
- **Combat Style**: Disarming wit backed by binding clauses; hexes that obligate foes to honor their last stated intent.
- **Signature Move**: Accord of Still Tongues—imposes a ceasefire that breaks if any party lies.

### Classroom & Teaching Environment

Tiered debate court with oath-ink quills that record contradictions; shelves of precedent stones from prior planar disputes.

### Quotes

- “If your treaty needs a sword, sharpen your clauses instead.”
- “Consent is the strongest ward.”
- “Truth told twice becomes policy.”

### Encounter Ideas

- Mediate between an angelic patrol and local spirits over sanctuary rights.
- Draft an evacuation compact before a rift swallows a border town.
- Unmask a devil’s addendum smuggled into a long-standing truce.
