### Brundal’thuun

Ancient Sea Dragon

### Role

Professor of **Elemental Binding**

**College**: Academy of Archano-Elemental and Techno Mechanics

**Major**: Elemental Binding

### Personality

Booming, benevolent, and fond of practical jokes that teach resilience. Brundal’thuun expects adaptability in storms and patience in calms.

### Description

Teal-and-deep-sea scales with kelp-fringed fins; barnacle-scratches trace old routes along his flanks. His laughter rolls like surf.

### Background

Former harbor-warden and typhoon shepherd, he bound storms to spare coastal towns and learned the price of arrogance. He now teaches respect before command.

### Classes Taught

- **ELBD 224 – The Salt Pact: Binding Oceanic Forces**



### Academic Approach

- **Course Focus**: Oceanic elementals, tide engines, and weather compacts that favor life.
- **Teaching Style**: Dockside labs, boat drills, and ritual call-and-response with bound currents.
- **Philosophy**: The sea is a partner, not a pet.

### Faith and Combat Prowess

- **Faith Alignment**: Salt Covenant—promises sworn on foam and kept in port.
- **Combat Style**: Rip-current throws and crushing walls of water that steer foes away from civilians.
- **Signature Move**: Harbor’s Embrace—summons a protective swell that lifts allies out of danger.

### Classroom & Teaching Environment

An open-water basin with wave-makers and tethered elementals; flags signal changing conditions mid-lesson.

### Quotes

- "First learn to float, then to fly."
- "Ask the tide nicely; it remembers."
- "A good binding leaves room to breathe."

### Encounter Ideas

- Calm a storm elemental furious at overfishing.
- Escort aid ships through a sabotage-strewn channel.
- Rebind a rogue current that strands ships at low tide.
