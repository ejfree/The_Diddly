### Krillax Sparkjaw

Ancient Copper Dragon

### Role

Professor of **Arcanomechanics**

**College**: Academy of Archano-Elemental and Techno Mechanics

**Major**: Arcanomechanics

### Personality

Playful, improvisational, and ruthless about user safety. Krillax loves clever interfaces but loves fail-safes more.

### Description

Copper scales patinated in teal; a jawline studded with spark-gems clicks softly as he grins. Tools dangle from braided cords across his chest.

### Background

He built the first glove-free golem interface, then withdrew it after a misuse injury. Since then, he designs systems that fail politely.

### Classes Taught

- **AMCH 210 – Golem Interface Engineering**

### Academic Approach

- **Course Focus**: Control surfaces, error recovery, and consent-aware bindings between pilots and constructs.
- **Teaching Style**: Rapid prototyping, user testing with staged faults, and ‘bug bounties’ for students.
- **Philosophy**: Make it delightful—and impossible to misuse.

### Faith and Combat Prowess

- **Faith Alignment**: Tinker’s Oath—mirth in service of safety.
- **Combat Style**: Trick shots and ricochet wards that turn hazards into gags instead of wounds.
- **Signature Move**: Sparkjaw Wink—redirects a hostile surge into a harmless fireworks cascade.

### Classroom & Teaching Environment

Makerspace full of loaner kits, soft walls, and a scoreboard for ‘most elegant rollback’.

### Quotes

- "The user is always stronger than you think—protect them from you."
- "A good interface forgives."
- "If it fails funny, it fails safe."

### Encounter Ideas

- Refit a militia’s golems with nonlethal defaults.
- Out-maneuver a saboteur by turning their kill switch into a prank.
- Build an accessibility rig for a wounded veteran pilot.
