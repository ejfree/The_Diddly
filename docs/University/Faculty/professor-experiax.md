### Professor Experiax

Ancient Black Dragon

### Role

Professor of **History**

**College**: College of Lore

**Major**: History

### Personality

Experiax is a master of dry wit and calculated pauses. He rarely raises his voice, letting silence pressure students into revealing what they know—or hope to hide. Yet he is unfailingly fair, rewarding diligence and courage even when the truth uncovered is uncomfortable.

### Description

His scales gleam like wet ink, swallowing torchlight until only the glistening edges of his maw remain. Obsidian spines ridge his back, etched with sigils that glow when he invokes memories. In humanoid guise he appears as a thin archivist draped in vellum sashes covered in redacted lines.

### Background

Experiax once served as the Conclave’s clandestine historian, charged with purging records that could destabilize dragonkind. Witnessing the cost of enforced ignorance, he absconded with the very chronicles he was ordered to destroy and sought sanctuary at the Diddly, where he now teaches dragons to confront buried histories responsibly.

### Classes Taught

- **HIST 239 – Ethics of Erasure: Censorship and its Consequences**
- **HIST 333 – Shadow Archives Lab: Reconstructing Redacted Records**
- Guest colloquia on evidentiary divinations for HIST 217 “Historiomancy.”

### Academic Approach

- **Course Focus**: Experiax dissects censored chronicles, teaching students how to reconstruct events from fragments, witness testimony, and forensic spellwork.
- **Teaching Style**: Seminars unfold like investigations; he assigns conflicting dossiers and forces teams to collaborate with rival perspectives, revealing withheld evidence at critical moments.
- **Philosophy**: “Truth is a double-edged blade—learn where to aim it, and when to sheath it.”

### Faith and Combat Prowess

- **Faith Alignment**: Keeper of the Obsidian Ledger, an order sworn to protect knowledge deemed too volatile for historians who lack context.
- **Combat Style**: Prefers ambush and attrition, coating the battlefield with corrosive mists while illusions rewrite the terrain with incriminating scenes.
- **Signature Move**: *Ink of Oblivion*—Experiax exhales shadow-script that erases an enemy’s recent actions from memory while preserving the evidence in a crystal for future lesson plans.

### Classroom & Teaching Environment

The Eclipsed Archive lies deep beneath the library, walls lined with memory crystals that pulse with captured testimonies. Desks record every spoken word, replaying contradictions until a student reconciles the narrative.

### Quotes

- “History buried becomes history weaponized.”
- “Ask who profits from silence before you accept it.”
- “Make room on the shelf for truths that hurt.”

### Encounter Ideas

- Experiax hires the party to intercept a forged chronicle intended to incite war between dragon flights.
- A rogue shadow spawned from suppressed memories stalks the Archive; he needs adventurers to confront it without destroying the knowledge it carries.
- The professor requests escorts on a clandestine visit to a tyrant’s vault, where he plans to copy records before they are erased forever.
