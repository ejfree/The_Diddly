### Dean Vysathrix the Blue Depth

Ancient Cerulean Dragon

### Role

Dean of **Mineral Extraction & Refinement**

**College**: School of Yield Surging

**Major**: Mineral Extraction & Refinement

### Personality

Vysathrix is known for her deep wisdom and serene demeanor, often mediating conflicts and providing counsel to other deans and faculty members at the university. However, when it comes to protecting the oceans' resources, she shows a fierce determination and unyielding resolve.

### Description

Vysathrix, with scales that shermer like the deepest parts of the ocean, is a majestic cerulean dragon whose presence commands respect and admiration. Her eyes, reflecting the hues of marine abysses, convey a calm and calculating intellect. Large, webbed wings and a tail that tapers to a powerful, fin-like end make her an agile navigator of both air and water environments.

### Background

Born in the submerged caverns of the Sapphire Trench, Vysathrix grew up surrounded by the mysteries of the deep. From a young age, she was fascinated by the mineral-rich volcanic vents and the unique ecosystems they supported. Her early years were spent exploring underwater ruins and learning about the forces that shape the ocean floor.

### Classes Taught

- **MINX 342 – Abyssal Vein Mapping and Yield Stabilization**



### Academic Approach

- **Course Focus**: Vysathrix stresses ecological accountability, teaching how to read submarine strata and identify veins that can be tapped without collapsing reefs.
- **Teaching Style**: Vysathrix has pioneered several groundbreaking extraction techniques that minimize environmental impact while maximizing efficiency. her notable contributions include the development of the Cyclonic Drill, a device that uses water currents to assist in the drilling process, and the Reef Restoration project, which ensures that aquatic life flourishes even in areas affected by mining.
- **Philosophy**: Despite her administrative duties, Vysathrix remains a scholar at heart. She insists that every extraction plan include a restoration phase—“Return more life than you remove.”

### Faith and Combat Prowess

- **Faith Alignment**: Tidewarden of the Abyssal Stewardship, a druidic tide cult that blesses those who heal damaged seas.
- **Combat Style**: She commands surging currents and crushing pressure, forcing foes into watery prisons while siphoning minerals to reinforce allies.
- **Signature Move**: *Maelstrom Crucible*—Vysathrix summons a spiraling vortex that strips weapons and armor, refining them into shimmering scales that harden her hide.

### Classroom & Teaching Environment

Her lecture dome, the Pelagic Observatory, is submerged beneath the academy harbor. Transparent walls provide a living backdrop of coral regrowth while geomantic holograms float overhead. Students run drills in pressure-controlled pods before venturing into real trenches.

### Quotes

- “A mine without a plan for healing is merely a scar on the world.”
- “Listen to the currents—they carry reports long before merchants do.”
- “Refinement begins with respect for what you disturb.”

### Encounter Ideas

- A corporate consortium attempts to strip-mine a sacred reef; Vysathrix hires the party to gather evidence and rally political allies.
- An experimental drill goes silent in the abyss; she sends the heroes to recover the crew before volcanic vents erupt.
- Smugglers poison the currents with alchemical runoff—Vysathrix needs adventurers to stop the spill and retrieve the ringleader for tribunal.
