### Beltane Sheerwing

Ancient Solar Dragon

### Role

Professor of **Magical Theory**

**College**: Quintessence Institute

**Major**: Magical Theory

### Personality

Radiant, contemplative, and generous with praise that pushes students higher. Beltane asks big questions and insists answers uplift.

### Description

Solar-gold pinions edged with white corona; when he speaks, dust motes orbit like tiny planets.

### Background

He traced ‘first spells’ across cultures and found kindness in their origins. Now he teaches that power’s oldest purpose was care.

### Classes Taught

- **MATH 243 – The Origin of Spells**



### Academic Approach

- **Course Focus**: Proto-thaumaturgy, moral roots of magic, and reconstructing origins to repair misuse.
- **Teaching Style**: Story-backed lectures, service practicum, and ritual reenactments with modern safeguards.
- **Philosophy**: Shine so others see, not so you are seen.

### Faith and Combat Prowess

- **Faith Alignment**: Covenant of Dawn—light for guidance, not glare.
- **Combat Style**: Blinding flares that reveal paths and strip malice from enchantments.
- **Signature Move**: Sheerwing Halo—sanctifies a space; hostile spells dim to safe embers.

### Classroom & Teaching Environment

Sunlit atrium with heliographs, prism altars, and a kindness ledger for class projects.

### Quotes

- "Origins matter—return to them with care."
- "Light is a promise you keep."
- "Brilliance without benevolence is just glare."

### Encounter Ideas

- Restore a misused blessing to its healing form.
- Expose a ‘holy’ rite that hides exploitation.
- Recreate a lost lantern ritual to guide refugees.
