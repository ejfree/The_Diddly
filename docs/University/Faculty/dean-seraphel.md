### Background

Her role at the Quintessence Institute involves not only teaching but also actively participating in high-stakes diplomatic missions. She often represents Dragon University in international summits and secret negotiations with other magical and mortal realms. Her expertise is especially sought after in conflicts that threaten the delicate balance between different magical species and kingdoms.

### Classes Taught

- **POLI 340 – Shadow Treaties and Double Binds**



### Academic Approach

- **Course Focus**: Seraphel guides dragons through the mechanics of coalition building, back-channel negotiations, and the calculus of sanctioned secrets.
- **Teaching Style**: She orchestrates live scenario labs using illusionary courts and contested borders, pausing the action to dissect emotional tells and framing devices.
- **Philosophy**: she emphasizes the importance of understanding cultural nuances, historical grievances, and the strategic use of both verbal and non-verbal communication. Her students learn not just the theory of diplomacy, but also practical skills such as drafting treaties, managing espionage networks, and the art of persuasion and compromise.

### Faith and Combat Prowess

- **Faith Alignment**: Seraphel venerates the Radiant Accord, a paradise-dragon creed that views diplomacy as sacred stewardship of peace.
- **Combat Style**: She prefers pacifying radiance and binding words, dazzling foes with harmonic light while stripping malice from the battlefield.
- **Signature Move**: *Edict of Tranquility*—Seraphel projects a wave of golden light that compels hostile creatures to parley, granting allies advantage in negotiations or disengagement.

### Classroom & Teaching Environment

Her “Sphere of Accord” classroom is a transparent dome suspended over the campus lake. Illusionary banners of rival nations flutter overhead while levitating lecterns display live dossiers. Students rotate between debate pits, covert planning rooms, and observation balconies to experience every angle of a diplomatic crisis.

### Quotes

- “Every silence in a negotiation says more than your loudest threat.”
- “Mercy is not weakness; it is leverage wisely spent.”
- “Know the dream your opponent is protecting, and you will know how to reach them.”

### Encounter Ideas

- A summit between rival dragonflights teeters on war; Seraphel asks the party to serve as neutral envoys and uncover the saboteur fanning the flames.
- One of her protégés vanishes after infiltrating a spy network—Seraphel hires the heroes to extract the student without igniting an international incident.
- A cursed treaty resurfaces, compelling signatories to fulfill an ancient blood feud; Seraphel needs the party to retrieve the original clause before midnight.
