### Velmara Seercoil

Ancient Black Dragon

### Role

Professor of **History**

**College**: College of Lore

**Major**: History

### Personality

Velmara is meticulous, unsentimental, and famously allergic to legend dressed as fact. She trains students to love questions more than answers and to treat every source like a suspect until corroborated.

### Description

Oil-sheened black scales ripple like wet parchment; faint etch-marks along her frills recall acid and ink. Her pupils are pin-thin, lanterned by a cold violet glint whenever she scents a lie.

### Background

Former archivist of a marsh-buried necropolis, Velmara pioneered historiomancy protocols that reconstruct events from residue, echo, and testimony. After exposing a dynasty’s sanitized chronicle, she left court employ to teach methods that resist erasure.

### Classes Taught

- **HIST 217 – Historiomancy: Using Magic to Reconstruct the Past**



### Academic Approach

- **Course Focus**: Forensic timelines, memory-anchor calibration, and reconciling magical reconstruction with human testimony.
- **Teaching Style**: Lab-forward; students must defend every conclusion with cross-sourced evidence and uncertainty margins.
- **Philosophy**: Truth is a method, not a mood.

### Faith and Combat Prowess

- **Faith Alignment**: Archivist of the Drowned Ledger—sworn to keep the record even when it condemns the powerful.
- **Combat Style**: Corrosive wards and binding ink-chains that dissolve glamers and false recollections.
- **Signature Move**: Acid Scriptorium—casts a glyphic circle that erodes illusions and forces compelled testimony to break.

### Classroom & Teaching Environment

An amphitheater scriptorium ringed by memory basins and echo-lattices; chalkboards list uncertainty intervals beside dates.

### Quotes

- "If the source resists questions, question harder."
- "We do not unearth truth; we assemble it."
- "Absence is a data point—label it."

### Encounter Ideas

- Verify a village’s contested atrocity when both sides have burned their records.
- Extract a memory-anchor from a flooded barrow before marsh gas eats the echo.
- Debunk a forged royal miracle without sparking a riot.
