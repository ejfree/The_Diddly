### Skelvar Ancestrune

Ancient Brass Dragon

### Role

Professor of **Ancient Relics and Artifacts**

**College**: College of Lore

**Major**: Ancient Relics and Artifacts

### Personality

Warm, inquisitive, and endlessly talkative. Skelvar coaxes stories from students as easily as he does from stones, rewarding curiosity and careful listening. He is patient with mistakes but relentless about proper citation and provenance.

### Description

Sun-burnished brass scales are etched with tiny memorial runes from sites he has restored. His voice carries a resonant timbre that seems to awaken whispers in carved pillars and inscribed monoliths. He travels light, save for a bandolier of chalks, rubbing papers, and tuning forks for resonance testing.

### Background

A former itinerant conservator of ruin-sites, Skelvar cataloged “singing stones” whose grooves retain emotional echoes. After negotiating the safe repatriation of a looted monument, he was invited to the Diddly to formalize his methods and train a new generation of ethical field historians.

### Classes Taught

- **ARAR 219 – Echoes in Stone: Monoliths and Inscribed Memory**



### Academic Approach

- **Course Focus**: Field identification, dating, and safe resonance-reading of inscribed relics; separating authentic mnemonic imprints from later propaganda cuts.
- **Teaching Style**: Seminar-lab hybrid with frequent site visits; call-and-response readings where students “voice” a stone while peers corroborate from secondary sources.
- **Philosophy**: “Artifacts remember what we forget—if we ask with care.”

### Faith and Combat Prowess

- **Faith Alignment**: Oath of Remembrance—vows to return names to nameless ruins and keep lineage records unbroken.
- **Combat Style**: Sonic pulses that disrupt harmful enchantments while stabilizing delicate structures; avoids collateral damage at all costs.
- **Signature Move**: Resonant Recollection—projects a harmonic that forces an enemy’s weapon or ward to “remember” its original oath, temporarily pacifying it.

### Classroom & Teaching Environment

Tiered stone amphitheater lined with replica friezes. A shallow reflecting pool doubles as a soundboard for resonance experiments; the walls hum softly with recorded site-tones during lectures.

### Quotes

- “Chisel once for glory and a second time for truth.”
- “If a stone will not sing, do not raise your voice—lower your questions.”
- “Provenance is a promise kept across centuries.”

### Encounter Ideas

- A border lord refuses to return a pillaged stele; Skelvar asks the party to negotiate—or prove its origin via resonance.
- A monolith begins broadcasting a war chant at night; identify the counterfeit groove and restore the original memorial.
- A collapsed archive traps an echo spirit; extract it without letting the ruin destabilize.
