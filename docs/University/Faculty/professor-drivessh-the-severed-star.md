### Drivessh the Severed Star

Ancient Copper Dragon

### Role

Professor of **Magical Theory**

**College**: Quintessence Institute

**Major**: Magical Theory

### Personality

Impish, brilliant, and fond of breaking bad assumptions rather than rules. Drivessh turns paradox into playgrounds for proof.

### Description

Copper scales with star-cut facets; laughter leaves sparks that arrange into diagrams.

### Background

He cataloged anomalous geometries that warped magic in unsafe ways, then wrote games that teach students to spot them before they bleed.

### Classes Taught

- **MATH 236 – Forbidden Structures: Anomalous Spell Geometry**



### Academic Approach

- **Course Focus**: Non-Euclidean spellforms, paradox traps, and safe exploitation of weirdness.
- **Teaching Style**: Puzzle labs, collaborative problem hunts, and playful adversarial testing.
- **Philosophy**: Curiosity tastes better with caution.

### Faith and Combat Prowess

- **Faith Alignment**: Trickster’s Ledger—jokes that protect the vulnerable.
- **Combat Style**: Mirage pivots that cause hostile spells to miss intentions, not just targets.
- **Signature Move**: Severed Star—snips a paradox so its energy unwinds harmlessly.

### Classroom & Teaching Environment

Puzzle pit with rotating walls and a ‘weirdness meter’ that rates student designs.

### Quotes

- "If it contradicts itself, ask what it’s hiding."
- "Fun is a safety feature."
- "Weird isn’t wrong—unlabeled is wrong."

### Encounter Ideas

- Defuse a prank that accidentally summoned a Klein bottle.
- Rescue a mage looping a sentence for three days.
- Weaponize a paradox to cancel a siege spell.
