### Yuladra Nightglen

Ancient White Dragon

### Role

Professor of **Political Intrigue and Diplomacy**

**College**: Quintessence Institute

**Major**: Political Intrigue and Diplomacy

### Personality

Cold-eyed, soft-voiced, and surgical with truths. Yuladra teaches that betrayal is a tool—its ethics rest on who is spared, not who is cut.

### Description

Snow-pale scales with shadowed crevices; frost webs her whiskers when she smiles. Her gaze holds the stillness of a glacier about to calve.

### Background

Former spymistress of a polar confederacy, she retired after dismantling a coup with only three arrests and no executions. She now instructs restraint without mercy.

### Classes Taught

- **POLI 244 – The Pact and the Knife: Betrayals in History**



### Academic Approach

- **Course Focus**: Counter-coup architectures, loyalty mapping, and exit routes that leave nations intact.
- **Teaching Style**: Hypothetical betrayals on the hour; students must justify collateral spared as well as targets chosen.
- **Philosophy**: Leave fewer widows than you make headlines.

### Faith and Combat Prowess

- **Faith Alignment**: White Truce—vows to end fights colder than they began.
- **Combat Style**: Chill fields that slow bloodlust and sharpen judgment.
- **Signature Move**: Nightglen Cut—severs the keystone tie in a conspiracy, collapsing it without spectacle.

### Classroom & Teaching Environment

Windowless chamber lit by cold lanterns; walls host flowcharts of past betrayals annotated with spared lives.

### Quotes

- "A clean cut heals; a jagged one festers."
- "If you must break trust, break it once."
- "Mercy is accuracy applied to people."

### Encounter Ideas

- Extract a double agent without compromising a fragile peace.
- Infiltrate a conclave to swap a manifesto before it spreads.
- Identify the one arrest that unravels a cabal.
