### Kellith Oathvine

Ancient Red Dragon

### Role

Professor of **Political Intrigue and Diplomacy**

**College**: Quintessence Institute

**Major**: Political Intrigue and Diplomacy

### Personality

Smoldering charm wrapped around iron discipline. Kellith teaches that influence burns brightest when it warms more than it scorches.

### Description

Crimson scales with dark vine-like etching; heat shimmer wreathes her horns when a lie is told nearby.

### Background

She once ran a whisper network to topple tyrants, then stayed to build institutions in the quiet after. She now instructs spies to become stewards.

### Classes Taught

- **POLI 219 – The Whisper Network: Espionage in Diplomacy**



### Academic Approach

- **Course Focus**: Intelligence ethics, counter-manipulation, and building alliances that survive daylight.
- **Teaching Style**: Shadowboard exercises, debrief circles, and roleplay with shifting loyalties.
- **Philosophy**: Secrets are debts—pay them back cleanly.

### Faith and Combat Prowess

- **Faith Alignment**: Oathvine Covenant—bonds that bind ambition to duty.
- **Combat Style**: Heat mirages and binding geasa that halt violence without humiliation.
- **Signature Move**: Red Ribbon—ties a conspirator’s intent to a public promise.

### Classroom & Teaching Environment

Mirror-lit chamber with sound baffles and a ‘truth garden’ where students plant oaths they’re willing to be measured by.

### Quotes

- "Power that can’t face witnesses isn’t power—it’s panic."
- "Make secrets obsolete by telling better stories."
- "Tie your ambition to someone worth serving."

### Encounter Ideas

- Turn a blackmail scheme into a confession that heals.
- Flip a spy ring into a watchdog that serves the public.
- Smother a rumor war with verifiable truth.
