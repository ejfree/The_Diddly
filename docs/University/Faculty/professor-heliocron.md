### Heliocron

Ancient Time Dragon

### Role

Professor of **Planar Studies**

**College**: Quintessence Institute

**Major**: Planar Studies

### Personality

Unhurried, precise, and fond of timelines that spiral rather than point. Heliocron teaches patience as a planar instrument.

### Description

Bronzed clockwork patterning under time-gold scales; gears seem to click just out of earshot when he turns.

### Background

Former archivist of a temporal lighthouse that warned travelers of shifting tides; he now trains navigators to sail time without sinking memory.

### Classes Taught

- **PLAN 230 – Tides of Time: The Temporal Planes**



### Academic Approach

- **Course Focus**: Temporal gradients, time-sick ecology, and responsible intervention windows.
- **Teaching Style**: Simulated chronowaves, paired journals with future selves, and slow labs.
- **Philosophy**: The right moment is as real as any place.

### Faith and Combat Prowess

- **Faith Alignment**: Custodians of the Hour—guardians of shared memory.
- **Combat Style**: Delay fields, rewind snippets, and momentum lending to allies.
- **Signature Move**: Tide of Time—rolls a gentle surge that resets harmful states.

### Classroom & Teaching Environment

Orrery of hours with adjustable tides; sands trickle upward during office hours.

### Quotes

- "Haste is a poor cartographer."
- "Record before you repair."
- "A shared past is the kindest gift."

### Encounter Ideas

- Ease a town’s time sickness from a botched harvest loop.
- Pilot a convoy through a temporal riptide.
- Unwind a tyrant’s personal rewind without erasing witnesses.
