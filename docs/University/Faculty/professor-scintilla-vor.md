### Scintilla Vor

Ancient Bronze Dragon

### Role

Professor of **Magical Theory**

**College**: Quintessence Institute

**Major**: Magical Theory

### Personality

Spark-bright, puckish, and rigorous. Scintilla loves the moment a paradox teaches humility.

### Description

Bronze scales with tiny prismatic flares; her laughter leaves question marks in the air.

### Background

She once broke a ducal spellbook by asking it to justify itself. She now teaches students to ask first, cast later.

### Classes Taught

- **MATH 229 – Paradox Magic: When Spells Break Their Own Rules**



### Academic Approach

- **Course Focus**: Paradox taxonomies, self-contradicting spells, and safe containment.
- **Teaching Style**: Debate clubs, thought experiments, and bug hunts.
- **Philosophy**: Clever only counts if it’s kind.

### Faith and Combat Prowess

- **Faith Alignment**: Open Question—curiosity in service to others.
- **Combat Style**: Logical snares that make attacks refute themselves.
- **Signature Move**: Vor’s Rejoinder—unmakes a spell by restating it truthfully.

### Classroom & Teaching Environment

Debate amphitheater with paradox boards and a ‘you first’ bell.

### Quotes

- "Ask it why before how."
- "Contradictions are kindness in disguise."
- "Be delighted to be wrong."

### Encounter Ideas

- Trap a curse in its own premise.
- Convince a spell-duelist to concede to logic.
- Disarm a maze that cancels itself when mapped honestly.
