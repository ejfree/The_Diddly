### Xirrel Grudgefire

Ancient Infernal Dragon

### Role

Professor of **Eldritch Engineering**

**College**: Academy of Archano-Elemental and Techno Mechanics

**Major**: Eldritch Engineering

### Personality

Caustic humor, relentless standards, and a taste for turning malice into utility. Xirrel respects ingenuity that tames dangerous systems without declawing their potential.

### Description

Char-scarred plates over a core of emberlight; chain-script runes twine his horns. Sparks skip along his jaw when he’s thinking.

### Background

Once contracted to weaponize field-curses, he walked away after witnessing collateral soul-burn. He now repurposes curse logic for infrastructure and worker protections.

### Classes Taught

- **ELEN 210 – Curses as Utility Matrices**



### Academic Approach

- **Course Focus**: Curse matrices as circuits—load-balancing, fail-safes, and reversible bindings.
- **Teaching Style**: Proof-of-ethics attached to every prototype; timed audits and peer red-teaming.
- **Philosophy**: Power must be defeatable by design.

### Faith and Combat Prowess

- **Faith Alignment**: Ember Ledger adjunct—contracts rewritten to protect the many.
- **Combat Style**: Snare hostile spells with chain-wards, invert vectors, and shunt force into ground.
- **Signature Move**: Cinder Reversion—collapses an enemy curse into a harmless spark that fuels an ally’s shield.

### Classroom & Teaching Environment

An industrial lab of insulated plinths, impact curtains, and a scoreboard that tracks successful reversions vs. accidental detonations.

### Quotes

- "A curse is just a circuit with attitude."
- "If it can’t be turned off, it was never yours."
- "We don’t fear flames; we give them jobs."

### Encounter Ideas

- Neutralize a mine’s legacy hex so workers can enter safely.
- Out-engineer a rival who booby-trapped public fountains with petty malisons.
- Capture a roaming curse and ‘plug’ it into city warding.
