### Arinth Talonshade

Ancient Sapphire Dragon

### Role

Professor of **Eldritch Engineering**

**College**: Academy of Archano-Elemental and Techno Mechanics

**Major**: Eldritch Engineering

### Personality

Reserved, exacting, and fascinated by edge cases. Arinth rewards students who ask, “Should we?” before “Can we?”

### Description

Sapphire facets patterned like fault lines; his gaze refracts light into schematics. Cold ozone lingers after his lectures.

### Background

Former black-site engineer who powered cities with ‘unacceptable’ sources, he shut the projects down from within and now teaches safer substitutions and sunset plans.

### Classes Taught

- **ELEN 234 – Forbidden Power Sources**



### Academic Approach

- **Course Focus**: Risk modeling for forbidden fuels, containment architectures, and ethical decommissioning.
- **Teaching Style**: Design reviews with kill-switch drills; failure premortems before prototyping.
- **Philosophy**: A good design includes its own goodbye.

### Faith and Combat Prowess

- **Faith Alignment**: Oath of the Blue Line—never cross a boundary you can’t redraw.
- **Combat Style**: Hard light cages and power siphons that starve hostile engines.
- **Signature Move**: Talonshade Tripwire—severs a device from its fuel without detonation.

### Classroom & Teaching Environment

Shielded bay with containment rings, tripwire simulators, and an ‘ethics switch’ that cuts any bench at a shout.

### Quotes

- "Power is innocent; its uses aren’t."
- "Design the failure first."
- "If you cannot shut it down, do not turn it on."

### Encounter Ideas

- Replace a city’s cursed core without going dark.
- Dismantle a smugglers’ void engine safely.
- Audit a baron’s ‘free energy’ grant proposal.
