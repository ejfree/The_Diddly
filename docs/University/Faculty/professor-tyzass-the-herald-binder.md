### Tyzass the Herald-Binder

Ancient Copper Dragon

### Role

Professor of **Political Intrigue and Diplomacy**

**College**: Quintessence Institute

**Major**: Political Intrigue and Diplomacy

### Personality

Wry, theatrical, and relentless about precedent. Tyzass delights in finding the clause that saves a life and the ceremony that tames a crowd.

### Description

Coppery scales with laugh-lines etched at the jaw; scroll cases hang from a bandolier. His voice projects like a herald’s fanfare even in a whisper.

### Background

Once a royal herald who bound oaths between dragon courts and mortal thrones, he retired after refusing to announce a war. He now teaches how ritual, humor, and law defuse power.

### Classes Taught

- **POLI 225 – Dragon Courts and Mortal Thrones**



### Academic Approach

- **Course Focus**: Ceremony as soft power, oath architecture, and media of the message—banners, bells, and breath.
- **Teaching Style**: Mock courts, satirical briefs, and live exercises in crowd temperature control.
- **Philosophy**: If the people don’t understand it, it isn’t binding.

### Faith and Combat Prowess

- **Faith Alignment**: Covenant of the Common Tongue—truths spoken plainly.
- **Combat Style**: Trickster feints and binding proclamations that turn a mob into an audience.
- **Signature Move**: Herald’s Arrest—names a deed and freezes it mid-act until judgment.

### Classroom & Teaching Environment

A miniature court with gallery seating and a props room of sashes, seals, and bells for live ritual drills.

### Quotes

- "Clarity is the kindest weapon."
- "A laugh can lower a sword."
- "Bind the deed, free the person."

### Encounter Ideas

- Defuse a coronation crisis by composing an inclusive oath overnight.
- Turn a riot into a referendum through lawful spectacle.
- Expose a tyrant’s forged proclamation with heraldic forensics.
