### Ienwe Suncleft

Ancient Copper Dragon

### Role

Professor of **Ancient Relics and Artifacts**

**College**: College of Lore

**Major**: Ancient Relics and Artifacts

### Personality

Sunny, skeptical, and allergic to false halos. Ienwe delights in puncturing pomp to save people from it.

### Description

Copper scales with sunburst patina; she wears a ring of keys from reliquaries she made safe.

### Background

Recovered ‘holy’ artifacts that demanded too much. She wrote the first compassionate protocols for deconsecrating dangerous idols.

### Classes Taught

- **ARAR 240 – Cult Relics and False Icons**

### Academic Approach

- **Course Focus**: Cult artifact analysis, community harm reduction, and restorative reburial.
- **Teaching Style**: Roleplay with stakeholders, lab deconsecrations, and gossip mapping to track harms.
- **Philosophy**: Save believers by saving them from their tools.

### Faith and Combat Prowess

- **Faith Alignment**: Common Altar—reveres shared meals over sacred weapons.
- **Combat Style**: Laughing feints and binding ribbons that disarm without humiliating.
- **Signature Move**: Suncleft Key—locks a relic’s appetite behind gentle wards.

### Classroom & Teaching Environment

A bright lab of reliquary mockups, community seating, and a wall of ‘retired miracles’.

### Quotes

- "If it needs worship to work, ask what it’s eating."
- "Kindness is the only sacred I trust."
- "Relics are tools—don’t let them tool you."

### Encounter Ideas

- Defang a relic that punishes doubt, not harm.
- Return a saint’s blade to rest without starting a riot.
- Negotiate with a cult to turn an idol into a memorial.
