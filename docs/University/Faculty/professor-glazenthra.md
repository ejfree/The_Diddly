## Professor Glazenthra

Ancient Black Dragon

### Role

Professor of **History**

**College**: College of Lore

**Major**: History

### Personality

Pragmatic, caustic, and obsessed with structure. Glazenthra trains historians to see systems, not heroes.

### Description

Oil-dark scales with marshlight gleam; ink stains her clawtips. Her pupils narrow to needles when sources wobble.

### Background

Raised in communal barrows where survival depended on shared labor, she documents how empires erase the villages that fed them.

### Classes Taught

- **HIST 208 – The Rise and Fall of Empires**



### Academic Approach

- **Course Focus**: Material conditions, logistics, and the politics of food and water.
- **Teaching Style**: Provides lessons on the communal living and societal structures of ancient dragon colonies.
- **Philosophy**: History is what people ate, carried, and built together.

### Faith and Combat Prowess

- **Faith Alignment**: Accountant of the Drowned Storehouse—keeps the ledger for the forgotten.
- **Combat Style**: Acidic erasures that strip pomp and leave intent.
- **Signature Move**: Black Ledger—reveals hidden costs in an enemy’s power, weakening it.

### Classroom & Teaching Environment

Map room with grain-flow charts, census rolls, and supply-line models students can walk.

### Quotes

- "Find the kitchen, find the truth."
- "Glory is a rounding error."
- "If the source flatters, distrust it."

### Encounter Ideas

- Reconstruct a famine hidden by court poets.
- Map the supply lines that topple a tyrant without war.
- Prove a legend stole from a commune it praised.
