### Quorim Fluxthread

Ancient Gold Dragon

### Role

Professor of **Elemental Binding**

**College**: Academy of Archano-Elemental and Techno Mechanics

**Major**: Elemental Binding

### Personality

Bright, careful, and principled. Quorim believes binding is a contract, not a chain.

### Description

Gold scales with braided filaments like spun sunlight; his touch leaves warmth, not burns.

### Background

He negotiated an emancipation accord for abused elementals and rewrote campus binding policy with them at the table.

### Classes Taught

- **ELBD 240 – Ethics of Elemental Enslavement**



### Academic Approach

- **Course Focus**: Consent-based bindings, term limits, and mutual benefit design.
- **Teaching Style**: Co-taught sessions with willing elementals; reflection on power.
- **Philosophy**: Share the work, share the reward.

### Faith and Combat Prowess

- **Faith Alignment**: Compact of Bright Hands—aid that dignifies.
- **Combat Style**: Radiant bonds that hold only the harmful parts.
- **Signature Move**: Fluxthread Accord—binds a threat to a vow to cease.

### Classroom & Teaching Environment

Sunlit lab with guest quarters for elementals and a contract wall in plain language.

### Quotes

- "Every binding is a conversation."
- "If you cannot sign it yourself, don’t ask another to."
- "Power without consent is theft."

### Encounter Ideas

- Free a bound storm from an illegal engine.
- Write terms for a town to host a river spirit safely.
- Unwind a coercive pact without killing the bound.
