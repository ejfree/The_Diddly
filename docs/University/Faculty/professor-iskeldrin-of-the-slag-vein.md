### Iskeldrin of the Slag Vein

Ancient Bronze Dragon

### Role

Professor of **Mineral Extraction & Refinement**

**College**: School of Yield Surging

**Major**: Mineral Extraction & Refinement

### Personality

Gruff, generous, and intolerant of corner-cutting. Iskeldrin believes the best refinery is a community’s trust.

### Description

Bronze scales stained with heat-temper rainbow; slag pendants clink along his harness. Sparks stick to his smile.

### Background

He walked blast furnaces for a century and wrote the manual miners actually use. When a baron ignored his safety edicts, Iskeldrin shuttered the site himself and never looked back.

### Classes Taught

- **MINX 227 – Alchemic Purification of Ores**



### Academic Approach

- **Course Focus**: Purification chains, waste reclamation, and worker-first process design.
- **Teaching Style**: Furnace-floor practicums, rotating safety captains, and audits that reward prevention.
- **Philosophy**: Refine ore, not people.

### Faith and Combat Prowess

- **Faith Alignment**: Forgekeep—oaths to cool tempers before metal.
- **Combat Style**: Flash-quenches that lock hazards in place and shield bystanders.
- **Signature Move**: Slag Vein—draws impurities out of cursed metal and hurls them as inert glass.

### Classroom & Teaching Environment

Open foundry with transparent ducts and capture runes; students log emissions alongside yields.

### Quotes

- "If your ledger forgets the lungs, it lies."
- "A clean pour starts with a clean plan."
- "Safety isn’t paperwork—it’s promises kept."

### Encounter Ideas

- Clean a river tainted by illegal smelters.
- Recast a cursed ingot into safe components.
- Audit a refinery before a strike turns explosive.
