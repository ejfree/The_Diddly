### Dean Syltharion

Ancient Bronze Dragon

### Role

Dean of **Arcanomechanics**

**College**: Academy of Archano-elemental and Techno Mechanics

**Major**: Arcanomechanics

### Personality

Wise and inventive, Syltharion embodies the fusion of magic and machinery. He has an enduring curiosity about the universe, which makes him a beloved figure among students and faculty alike. His laughter, much like the rumble of distant thunder, often fills the halls of the academy during his less formal lectures. However, he maintains a strict discipline when it comes to academic integrity and the safety protocols of experimental arcanomechanics.

### Description

Syltharion maintains his dragon form even within the academic halls, showcasing his massive, shimmering bronze scales that seem to glow slightly with arcane energy. His eyes are deep turquoise, reflecting a mind that is both ancient and keenly attuned to the nuances of magic and mechanics. When moving through the smaller spaces of the university, he can transform into a distinguished older man with a long, flowing beard interspersed with bronze streaks, wearing ornate robes decorated with symbols of gears and arcane sigils.

### Background

Born during the Age of Wonder, when dragons openly mingled with other races, Syltharion quickly developed a fascination with the burgeoning field of arcanomechanics—the blend of arcane arts and mechanical science. His centuries of study have made him an unparalleled expert in this field. His leadership at the Academy of Archano-elemental and Techno Mechanics has brought it to new heights of innovation and prestige.

### Classes Taught

...

### Academic Approach

- **Course Focus**: Syltharion zeroes in on integrating spell matrices with mechanical feedback loops, teaching students to balance efficiency with safety.
- **Teaching Style**: He rotates between chalkboard derivations, live tinkering sessions, and surprise inspections of student workshops to reinforce meticulous craftsmanship.
- **Philosophy**: Syltharion aims to guide his students not just to learn but to think innovatively, blending magic and technology to create solutions that could benefit all of dragonkind

### Faith and Combat Prowess

- **Faith Alignment**: Devoted to the Cogwheel Synod, a coalition of dragons and gearsmiths who view invention as sacred service.
- **Combat Style**: Fights alongside arcane automatons of his own design, chaining lightning through conductive arrays to disable foes non-lethally.
- **Signature Move**: *Avalanche of Brass*—Syltharion activates portable constructs that unfold into a whirring shield wall, then launches them as electrified projectiles.

### Classroom & Teaching Environment

His laboratory, the Dynamo Vault, is a cavernous space filled with hovering platforms and self-writing schematics. Safety wards read vital signs while conveyor runes deliver components on command. Students must badge in with personalized sigils, reinforcing accountability.

### Quotes

- “Measure twice, enchant once.”
- “A machine without empathy is just a weapon waiting to misfire.”
- “Innovation thrives where curiosity meets discipline.”

### Encounter Ideas

- A prototype guardian goes missing—Syltharion hires the party to track it before the malfunctioning construct harms civilians.
- Funding for the Vault is threatened by traditionalists; he requests the heroes gather proof that his inventions saved a frontier city.
- A planar outage disrupts the academy’s power grid; Syltharion needs adventurers to enter the lightning plane and jump-start the conduit.
