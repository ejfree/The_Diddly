### Dean Syltharion

Ancient Bronze Dragon

### Role

Dean of **Arcanomechanics**

**College**: Academy of Archano-elemental and Techno Mechanics

**Major**: Arcanomechanics

### Personality

Wise and inventive, Syltharion embodies the fusion of magic and machinery. He has an enduring curiosity about the universe, which makes him a beloved figure among students and faculty alike. His laughter, much like the rumble of distant thunder, often fills the halls of the academy during his less formal lectures. However, he maintains a strict discipline when it comes to academic integrity and the safety protocols of experimental arcanomechanics.

### Description

Syltharion maintains his dragon form even within the academic halls, showcasing his massive, shimmering bronze scales that seem to glow slightly with arcane energy. His eyes are deep turquoise, reflecting a mind that is both ancient and keenly attuned to the nuances of magic and mechanics. When moving through the smaller spaces of the university, he can transform into a distinguished older man with a long, flowing beard interspersed with bronze streaks, wearing ornate robes decorated with symbols of gears and arcane sigils.
