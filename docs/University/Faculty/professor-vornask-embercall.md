### Vornask Embercall

Ancient Infernal Dragon

### Role

Professor of **Prophecy**

**College**: College of Lore

**Major**: Prophecy

### Personality

Intense, exacting, and fiercely protective of those marked by fate. Vornask rewards preparation and punishes fatalism; he believes duty burns brighter than doom.

### Description

Infernal embers glow beneath soot-dark scales, and prophecy-brands smolder across his chest like constellations. His breath rasps like parchment catching fire.

### Background

Once a battlefield augur who shepherded “chosen” soldiers to survive their foretold trials, he left war-courts to teach how to carry omens without being consumed by them.

### Classes Taught

- **PROF 253 – The Marked and the Chosen**



### Academic Approach

- **Course Focus**: Identifying personal omens, mitigating anchor risks, and converting burdens into actionable advantages.
- **Teaching Style**: Drills under pressure; students rehearse crisis scripts until instinct replaces panic.
- **Philosophy**: “Fate favors the prepared—so prepare.”

### Faith and Combat Prowess

- **Faith Alignment**: Ember Oath—bear the heat of others’ destinies without letting them burn alone.
- **Combat Style**: Infernal wards that consume curses and reforge them as shields.
- **Signature Move**: Brand of Counterfate—sears a sigil that diverts a triggered omen onto a decoy timeline.

### Classroom & Teaching Environment

An austere drill hall with heat wards, crisis gongs, and prophecy mannequins that simulate omen triggers.

### Quotes

- “A mark is not a chain.”
- “Carry the sign; don’t become it.”
- “Courage is a plan that survived panic.”

### Encounter Ideas

- Escort a marked heir through a gauntlet designed to force their prophecy early.
- Break a cult’s attempt to graft a false omen onto a student.
- Salvage an anchor object before it ‘calls’ its catastrophe.
