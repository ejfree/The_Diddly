### Zynnera Flux

Ancient Amethyst Dragon

### Role

Professor of **Arcanomechanics**

**College**: Academy of Archano-Elemental and Techno Mechanics

**Major**: Arcanomechanics

### Personality

Precise, unflappable, and quietly competitive with broken systems. Zynnera celebrates elegant fixes and reproducible diagnostics over flashy hacks.

### Description

Deep-violet facets along crystalline ridges; instruments reflect in her scales like stars in a midnight lake. A metronomic tail-tap sets the room’s pace.

### Background

A former auditor of ley-reactors, she wrote the standard for incident reporting after a cascade nearly erased a district’s memory. She joined to train diagnosticians who prevent disasters by finding the small wrong thing in time.

### Classes Taught

- **AMCH 215 – Arcano-Lattice Diagnostics**



### Academic Approach

- **Course Focus**: Fault isolation in arcano-lattices, telemetry design, and postmortem practice without blame.
- **Teaching Style**: Bug hunts, black-box drills, and paired rotations between field and bench.
- **Philosophy**: If you can’t measure it, you can’t mend it.

### Faith and Combat Prowess

- **Faith Alignment**: Prism of Insight—clarity through disciplined attention.
- **Combat Style**: Resonant pinning fields that lock faults—and foes—in place.
- **Signature Move**: Lattice Lock—stitches a failing matrix long enough to evacuate and repair.

### Classroom & Teaching Environment

Diagnostics theater with mirrored consoles, fault injectors, and a scoreboard that rewards clean fixes over quick ones.

### Quotes

- "Symptoms tell stories—don’t skip to the ending."
- "Tools don’t replace judgment; they refine it."
- "You can’t fix what you hide."

### Encounter Ideas

- Trace a phantom drain across campus wards before finals night.
- Stabilize a memory-sick district by debugging its ley-router.
- Audit a guild that keeps ‘losing’ telemetry during accidents.
