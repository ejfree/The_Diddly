### Classes Taught


- **[Eldritch Engineering — Capstone Studio](../Academics/course-catalog.md#eldritch-engineering-capstone-studio)**
- **[Sustainable Megastructures Lab](../Academics/course-catalog.md#sustainable-megastructures-lab)**
- **[Runic Symbiosis Colloquium](../Academics/course-catalog.md#runic-symbiosis-colloquium)**

### Academic Approach

- **Course Focus**: Her curriculum marries structural engineering with geomancy, teaching dragons to weave ley lines into load-bearing matrices.
- **Teaching Style**:
  - **Architectural Magic Mastery:** Saphyrastrasz is a foremost expert in magical architecture, capable of designing and conjuring buildings and structures that are not only aesthetically magnificent but also imbued with magical properties, such as self-repair or adaptive environments.

  - **Creation of Self-Sustaining Environments:** She specializes in creating environments that maintain their own climate, energy, and ecosystems through a blend of high magic and elemental engineering.
- **Philosophy**: “Design for the seventh generation.” She mandates environmental audits on every project to prove the structure gives back more than it consumes.

### Faith and Combat Prowess

- **Faith Alignment**: Architect of the Sapphire Covenant, a draconic fellowship dedicated to building sanctuaries for displaced peoples.
- **Combat Style**: She shapes crystalline bulwarks mid-battle, redirecting spells through refracted ley currents to shield allies.
- **Signature Move**: *Prismatic Citadel*—Saphyrastrasz raises a shifting lattice of sapphire light that traps foes in a restorative maze while channeling ambient magic into her team.

### Classroom & Teaching Environment

Lectures take place in the Harmonic Atelier, a laboratory built atop a humming ley nexus. Modular platforms reconfigure themselves to match each assignment, and grown crystal spires serve as whiteboards where equations appear as etched facets.

### Quotes

- “A building is a promise—make sure you intend to keep it.”
- “Symmetry soothes, but asymmetry survives.”
- “Sustainability is simply remembering that magic, too, has a habitat.”

### Encounter Ideas

- A self-repairing dormitory goes feral after a sabotage attempt; Saphyrastrasz asks the party to enter its shifting halls and reset the control core.
- She sends the heroes to broker a supply treaty with earth elementals whose crystals are vital to the next campus expansion.
- A rival architect challenges her designs with destructive weather rituals; Saphyrastrasz enlists the adventurers to defend the construction site while she stabilizes the storm.
