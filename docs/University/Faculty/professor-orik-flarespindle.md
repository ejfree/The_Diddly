### Orik Flarespindle

Ancient Red Dragon

### Role

Professor of **Arcane Artifice and Enchantment Studies**

**College**: School of Yield Surging

**Major**: Arcane Artifice and Enchantment Studies

### Personality

Bombastic, brilliant, and rigorously results-driven. Orik rewards bold prototypes that don’t blow up the user.

### Description

Red scales with bronze sockets along his forearms; sparks pop when he laughs.

### Background

He crashed a royal lab’s output for chasing glamour over safety and rebuilt it into a cross-school foundry for practical tools.

### Classes Taught

- **AAES 226 – Cross-School Item Infusion**



### Academic Approach

- **Course Focus**: Cross-discipline infusion, thermal budgets, and interoperability.
- **Teaching Style**: Demo days, failure showcases, and peer sign-offs before deployment.
- **Philosophy**: Impress the field, not the court.

### Faith and Combat Prowess

- **Faith Alignment**: Forge Oath—heat used well.
- **Combat Style**: Arc-flare counters and heat siphons.
- **Signature Move**: Flarespindle Surge—overclocks an ally’s item within safe bounds.

### Classroom & Teaching Environment

Foundry floor with infusion rings, thermal cameras, and a ‘red tag’ station for unsafe ideas.

### Quotes

- "Make it useful; pretty will follow."
- "Failures belong on stage."
- "Hot is not the same as powerful."

### Encounter Ideas

- Retrofit city lanterns to resist frost magic overnight.
