### Personality

Steady, stubborn, and fair. Rhexidra believes authority should feel like bedrock underfoot.

She raised cities by bargaining with old stones and wrote the rites for crown-safe construction.

- **Philosophy**: Power sits best on kindness and keystones.

### Faith and Combat Prowess

Stone yard with thrones, pillars, and a shaking floor.
