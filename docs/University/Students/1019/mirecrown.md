**Name**: Mirecrown
**Dragon Type**: Bronze Dragon
**Year**: 4th Year (Wyvern Year)
**Major**: Planar Studies

### Personality
Patient, direct, and unglamorous about danger—Mirecrown treats “fun” as something you earn by being prepared. They have a dry sense of humor, a soft spot for first-years who pretend they aren’t scared, and a habit of narrating tracks like a lecture: “This is where the predator decided you were edible.”

### Description
A compact bronze dragon with scales dulled in places by peat stains and travel wear. Their horns flare into antler-like ridges, and their wing membranes carry a faint pattern like river deltas. Mirecrown often smells of rain and crushed reeds, and they carry a belt of practical gear: chalk, twine, a folding shovel, and a waterproof notebook full of field sketches.

### Room Details
Mirecrown’s dorm feels like a ranger station. The floor is layered with woven mats and drying racks for muddy boots and wet cloaks. The walls are pinned with maps of Lamannia “echo-sites” the club uses for safe excursions, each annotated with weather notes and creature signs. A small enchanted terrarium constantly cycles mist and drizzle (to “keep the nose honest”), and the centerpiece is a battered field pack hanging from a hook labeled: “CHECK THIS FIRST.”
