**Name**: Cinderburrow
**Dragon Type**: Magma Dragon
**Year**: 4th Year (Wyvern Year)
**Major**: Political Intrigue and Diplomacy

### Personality
Cheerful under pressure and relentlessly organized. Cinderburrow is the kind of dragon who can calm a panicking crowd while simultaneously assigning roles, spotting exits, and negotiating with whoever caused the problem in the first place. They love traditions, hate waste, and keep meticulous lists of who volunteered for what (and who still owes them a favor).

### Description
Dark basalt scales veined with ember-glow that brightens when they’re excited or annoyed. Their breath vents as warm steam through small cracks between scales, and their claws are permanently heat-polished. Cinderburrow wears braided cords of “event tokens” (wooden tags, little bells, badge ribbons) from past club outings, plus a whistle that can cut through a thunderstorm.

### Room Details
Half war-room, half cozy kiln. One wall is a corkboard covered in color-coded schedules, route maps, and contact lists; another is stacked with crates labeled “blankets,” “water,” “salt,” and “first-aid.” A low stone brazier keeps the room pleasantly warm, and a set of enchanted sand timers sits on the desk for timing drills and meeting agendas. The vibe is: “yes, we can have fun—after the safety briefing.”
