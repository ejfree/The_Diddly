Create murky. He is a solar drain who is also a weight lifter & lax bro. Kinda dumb, but quite lovable. He is a fraternity boy and loves to lay in the sun. Solar dragons can be any color of any sun, yellow, red, blue, or white.

Murky is a vibrant solar dragon, radiating a warm golden hue reminiscent of a yellow sun. With a muscular build from his dedication to weightlifting, he stands out not only for his physical prowess but also for his endearing, somewhat dimwitted charm. Murky is a proud member of his fraternity, often found lounging in the sun, basking in its rays, or engaging in lacrosse games with his bros. His lovable personality and laid-back attitude make him a favorite among his peers, embodying the spirit of carefree enjoyment and camaraderie.

He is a Primus and gives completely no shit on what happens
