---

**Name**: Swampclaw

**Dragon Type**: Green Dragon

**Year**: 5th Year, Primus

**Major**: Prophecy

### Personality:
Swampclaw is calm, collected, and meticulous in her work. She is known for her deep connection to nature and the earth, often preferring solitude to study the natural resources of the world. Swampclaw has a sharp, analytical mind, making her highly skilled in investigating prophecy. While introverted, she has a fierce loyalty to her friends and is always willing to offer advice on eco-friendly methods of resource management. Despite her quiet nature, she can be quite stubborn when defending her views on sustainable practices.

### Description:
Swampclaw is a large green dragon with emerald-hued scales that shimmer with a mossy, earthy sheen. Her wings have intricate patterns resembling leaves, and her eyes are a deep, forest green. She has long, sharp claws tinted with a dark brown color, making them appear like roots that have dug into the soil for centuries. Her horns are twisted like vines, and she often smells faintly of damp earth and fresh rain. Swampclaw’s tail is muscular and spiked, designed to burrow into the ground with ease during mineral exploration.

### Room Details:
Swampclaw’s dorm room is nestled in one of the subterranean halls at Dragon University, resembling a cave-like burrow. The walls are lined with shelves of minerals, rocks, and gems she’s collected from her expeditions. Her bed is made of soft moss and stones, giving the space an organic, forest-like atmosphere. The room is dimly lit by enchanted crystals that emit a gentle green glow. Potted plants and vines grow along the walls, and a small stream of water flows through one corner of the room, providing a calming, natural ambiance. It’s a reflection of her love for the earth and her desire to live in harmony with nature, even in her studies.
