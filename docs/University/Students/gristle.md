**Name**: Gristle

**Dragon Type**: Brass Dragon  

**Year**: 5th Year (Primus)  

**Major**: Arcanomechanics  

### Personality:
Gristle is a gregarious and highly talkative dragon who loves to engage in deep conversations about magical technology and ancient lore. He’s passionate about his studies and often seen tinkering with magical devices or experimenting with new recipes. His love for food is as intense as his love for magic, making him a natural fit as Chairman of The Draconic Gastronomy Guild. Gristle has a jovial, charismatic demeanor but can become quite intense when it comes to perfecting both his culinary and magical creations. He often enjoys sharing his work with friends and inviting others to taste-test his latest dishes.

### Description:
Gristle has shimmering bronze scales that glint in the sunlight, and his wings have a reddish hue on the underside. He has a stocky, muscular frame and short, slightly curved horns. His eyes are a warm amber, filled with curiosity. His claws are often stained with the remnants of food ingredients or magical residue from his projects. His smile is wide and welcoming, a common sight when he’s in the kitchen or the lab.

### Room Details:
Gristle’s dorm room is a mixture of a workshop and a kitchen. There are shelves lined with magical components and ancient books, along with a large central workbench covered in mechanical parts and enchanted tools. Near the entrance, there is a small cooking station with enchanted cookware that hovers and stirs on its own. The walls are decorated with various kitchen utensils and arcane blueprints, along with a corkboard filled with notes for both magical projects and potential new recipes. The room always smells like a combination of metal, herbs, and roasted meat, reflecting Gristle’s passion for both magic and culinary arts.
