The 20 year old "grand daughter" of Lysse the tea shop owner. Lisa is a 2nd year drake at the Diddly. She is also the RA for our group of adventurers in the first year. She will be in whatever wing our flight decides to be in.

Against the advice of her grandmother he is not a prophecy student, but majoring in Archanomechanics. Grandma hates the hard sciences and feels they are worthless.

Lisa loves fighting, specifically samurai style sword fighting.

In this imaginative setting, picture a young adult female emerald dragon named lisa who serves as a Resident Assistant (RA) in a university dorm. lisa's scales shimmer in various shades of green, ranging from deep forest to bright lime, catching the light as she moves. Despite her large, imposing size, she has a gentle demeanor and a warm, engaging smile that puts the students at ease.

lisa's dorm room is specially designed to accommodate her dragon features, with a large arched doorway and reinforced walls. Her presence is both awe-inspiring and comforting to the students. As an RA, she is incredibly responsible; she organizes activities that encourage camaraderie and supports students through their academic and personal challenges. Her ability to breathe fire comes in handy for barbecue nights on the dorm's rooftop terrace, a much-loved event among the students.

Her role goes beyond just enforcing rules; she's a mentor and a protector, using her keen dragon senses to ensure the safety and well-being of all residents. Her magical abilities, such as her empathetic connection to nature, are also a unique asset in creating a nurturing environment in the dorm.
