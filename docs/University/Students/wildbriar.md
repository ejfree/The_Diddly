**Name**: Wildbriar

**Dragon Type**: Forest Dragon

**Year**: 2nd Year (Drake Year)

**Major**: Mineral Extraction & Refinement

### Personality:
Wildbriar is calm and collected, often preferring the company of nature to large groups of dragons. He has a deep connection with the natural world, which influences his approach to Mineral Extraction, focusing on sustainable methods. While not particularly outgoing, he is friendly when approached and often shares wisdom in quiet moments. He’s known to be very resourceful and creative, especially when it comes to solving problems using natural elements.

### Description:
Wildbriar has deep green scales that shimmer with a subtle, almost bark-like texture. His wings are large with leafy veins that glow faintly when he’s near abundant plant life. His eyes are a soft, earthy brown, and his horns curl like twisted vines, adorned with small, bioluminescent fungi. His overall build is robust, more suited for maneuvering through dense forests than open skies. His claws are sharp, ideal for both digging and precise extraction techniques in his major.

### Room Details:
Wildbriar’s dorm is a blend of earthy tones, filled with potted plants that thrive even in the limited light. His bed is nestled in a nook made of intertwined roots, giving the impression of sleeping in the hollow of a great tree. There are shelves of minerals he has collected, each labeled and carefully stored. The room has a natural, woodsy scent, and the air is always slightly cooler and fresher than in the rest of the dorm. Magical lights resembling fireflies drift lazily above, illuminating the space in a soft, warm glow. His space is organized but cozy, reflecting his connection to nature and his major.
