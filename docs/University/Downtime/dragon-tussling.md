# Dragon Tussling


**The Top of the dragon tussling pyramid is called the Wyrmperor:** A fusion of "Wyrm," an old term for dragon, and "Emperor," suggesting a dragon of unparalleled strength and regal authority in the sumo wrestling world.

This also has an odd military connotation. In combination with the leader of the Council, they are the battle leaders of the dragon armies. The each control forces for a [day,week,month].



"Tusseling," the dragon sumo wrestling, is an intricate duel	 that combines elements of performance, physical prowess, and verbal dexterity. It is poart sport and part code duello. Dragons have realized that wanton destruction of their own kind is silly. But having a competition was important to showing who is best. It has been used to settle grudges, family disputes, or as sporting/gladatorial combat for entertainment. Imagine even crazier WWE shenanigans but with dragons. Here’s an expanded breakdown of the three phases of a Tusseling competition in your Pathfinder 2e game:

**Phase 1: The Grand Entrance (Performance Phase)**

* **Objective:** This phase is all about making a memorable entrance. Competitors use their charisma and flair to captivate the audience and intimidate their opponents.

* **Skill Check:** Performers make a Performance skill check. They could also use skills like Deception to feign confidence or Intimidation to unsettle their opponents.

* **Roleplay Element:** Dragons may display their heritage, for instance, a Fire Dragon might create a pyrotechnic display, while a Crystal Dragon could reflect mesmerizing light patterns.

* **Impact:** The results of this phase could grant minor bonuses or penalties in subsequent phases, reflecting the psychological impact of the entrance.

**Phase 2: The Physical Contest (Athletics Phase)**

* **Objective:** This is where the physical strength, agility, and skill of the dragons come into play, akin to traditional sumo wrestling.

* **Skill Check:** Dragons make Athletics or Acrobatics skill checks, depending on their style – brute force or agile maneuvers. This phase involves pushing, lifting, or maneuvering the opponent.

* **Tactical Play:** Competitors might have to decide between using raw power to overpower or agile movements to outmaneuver their opponent.

* **Variations:** Different tiers or dragon types might have unique rules or abilities they can leverage in this phase (like using their breath weapon in a controlled manner).

**Phase 3: The War of Words (Dialogue Phase)**

* **Objective:** Dragons engage in a verbal duel, showcasing their wisdom, wit, or intimidation skills. This phase symbolizes the mental and strategic aspect of Tusseling.

* **Skill Check:** Various talking skills like Diplomacy, Intimidation, Bluff, or even Arcana (to reference ancient lore or spells) can be used. Dragons could try to outwit, confuse, or demoralize their opponent.

* **Impact of Words:** This phase could influence the judges' scoring, sway the crowd’s favor, or even directly impact the opponent's morale, affecting their performance in a rematch or future rounds.

* **Cultural Significance:** This phase reflects the dragons’ tradition of wisdom, negotiation, and the importance of mental prowess.

**Scoring and Victory**

* The winner of a Tusseling match is determined based on the cumulative performance across all three phases. Points or advantages are awarded for each phase, and the dragon with the highest score or best overall performance is declared the winner.

* Tusseling is not just a test of strength but a comprehensive showcase of a dragon's capabilities, making it a highly respected and multifaceted sport in your game world.
