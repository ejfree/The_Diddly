# Dragon Tussling Pyramid

Here's a league system for your "Tussling" sport, featuring 10 tiers, each with 500 dragons. The goal is to climb the ladder by challenging dragons ahead of you in ranking. Players can only challenge dragons up to 5 places above their current rank. Winning the challenge allows them to swap places with the defeated dragon, advancing up the ladder.

### League Structure

- **Number of Tiers**: 10

- **Dragons per Tier**: 500 (Ranked from 1 to 500 within each tier)

- **Total Players**: 5,000 dragons (500 x 10 tiers)

- **Promotion & Demotion**: At the end of a season (or specified period), dragons can be promoted to higher tiers or demoted to lower tiers based on performance.

### Tiers Breakdown
1. **Tier 1** (The Apex League): Elite dragons, the top 500 dragons in the sport.
2. **Tier 2**: High-performing dragons aiming to reach the Apex League.
3. **Tier 3** to **Tier 9**: Competitive mid-tier dragons, steadily climbing the ranks.
4. **Tier 10** (Novice League): Entry-level dragons who are new to the sport.

### Challenge System

- **Challenge Limit**: Each dragon can only challenge opponents who are up to 5 places ahead of them.
    - Example: If a dragon is ranked 100, they can challenge any dragon ranked from 99 to 95.

- **Challenge Outcome**:
    - **If the challenger wins**, they swap places with the defeated dragon.
    - **If the challenger loses**, they remain in their current position.

### League Rules & Dynamics
1. **Challenge Frequency**: Dragons can challenge once per week (or another specified time frame).
2. **Promotion/Demotion Rules**:
    - **Promotion**: At the end of a season, the top 50 dragons in a tier are promoted to the tier above.
    - **Demotion**: The bottom 50 dragons in a tier are demoted to the tier below.
    - **Tier 1 Exception**: There is no promotion from Tier 1, but the bottom 50 of Tier 1 are demoted to Tier 2.
    - **Tier 10 Exception**: Tier 10 dragons cannot be demoted further but can only advance by moving into Tier 9 through performance.

3. **Special Events**:
    - Occasional special tournaments or events can allow dragons from lower tiers to challenge higher tiers beyond the 5-place limit for unique rewards or ranking boosts.

4. **Stalemates**:
    - If two dragons continually tie in their challenges (neither advancing), a sudden-death round with modified rules (e.g., shorter rounds or environmental hazards) may determine a winner.

5. **Inactivity Penalty**: Dragons who do not participate in challenges for a season are automatically moved down 25 places as a penalty for inactivity.

### Advancement Strategy

- **Top Tier Players**: The dragons in Tier 1 are the elite, but they must constantly defend their positions to avoid dropping down to Tier 2.

- **Mid-Tier Players**: The mid-range dragons in Tiers 5 through 9 are highly competitive. Dragons here often juggle between steady advancement and fending off challengers.

- **Lower Tier Players**: Dragons in Tiers 10 and 9 are mostly rookies or those who had recent poor performances. These dragons focus on gaining experience and consistently challenging others to climb the ladder.

This structure keeps the system dynamic, with dragons constantly vying for position through strategy and skill in the sport of "Tussling." It rewards active participants while encouraging fierce competition at every level.
