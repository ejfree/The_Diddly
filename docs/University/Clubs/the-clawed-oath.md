# The Clawed Oath

*A Secret Society at The Diddly University*

#### **Overview**
The Clawed Oath is one of the most exclusive and secretive societies within The Diddly University. Founded centuries ago by a cabal of elite warrior dragons, the society upholds traditions of strength, honor, and skill in combat. Membership is limited to **Wyvern (4th-year) and Primus (5th-year) students**, with a select number of **Drake (2nd-year) students** chosen as prospective initiates.

The society‚Äôs core tenets revolve around **honorable dueling, physical might, and strategic warfare**, fostering a deep respect for the traditions of dragonkind‚Äôs martial prowess. The Clawed Oath prides itself on producing the most disciplined warriors, who go on to lead, fight, and dominate in both battle and politics.

### **Membership & Recruitment**

**Eligibility:**  

- Only **Wyvern (4th-year) and Primus (5th-year) students** can be full members.  

- **Drake (2nd-year) students** may be selected as prospective initiates and must undergo trials.  

- Selection is done in utmost secrecy, with members handpicking initiates based on combat skill, cunning, and a willingness to push beyond their limits.  

**Initiation Rituals:**

- Prospective members must complete **The Tussle Rite**, a no-holds-barred sparring competition against other initiates while blindfolded. They are judged on resilience, strategy, and instinct.  

- Upon successful completion, initiates must take **The Clawed Oath**, vowing loyalty to the society and its ideals.  

- ????? The final test is **The Drake‚Äôs Descent**, where initiates must retrieve an artifact hidden within a perilous and magically warded underground chamber beneath The Diddly.  
‚Äî
Invitation to the First Tussle‚Ä¶.

**üî• THE CLAWED OATH üî•
An Invitation to the First Tussle**

**To the Strong,
the Proud,
the Unyielding.**
The time has come.
The shadows stir beneath the Hall of War,
and the flame of challenge flickers once more.
You have been **observed**.
You have been **measured**.
And now, you are **summoned**.

**üêâ TUSSLE NIGHT: THE FIRST TRIAL
When:** Emberday Eve, at the 9th Hour past Dusk

**Where:** *The Eyrie of Might*

**Dress:** None. Scale, claw, and courage only.

This is not a game. This is not sport.
This is the **First Trial of Prospectus** for the Clawed Oath.
No names. No titles. Only strength, will, and instinct.
You will **fight**.
You will **bleed**.
You may **fall**.
But if you rise
if you prove yourself not merely mighty, but worthy
then your claw may carve a path toward legacy.

**Bring no weapons.**

**Speak no names.**

**Tell no soul.**

To accept, arrive alone at the base of the shattered Obelisk near the old dueling pits.
A flame will guide you. Follow it without fear.
Should you decline‚Ä¶ no one will speak of it again.
Should you attend‚Ä¶ everything will change.

**Strength is Truth.**

**Might is Law.**

**Let the Tussle begin.**

*The Talons of the Eyrie*

‚Äî
This is initiation‚Ä¶

The Clawed Oath does not use parchment, couriers, or magical messaging for its invitations. Instead, delivery of the **Tussle Night invitation** is a **ritual of intimidation, symbolism, and secrecy**, designed to shake the prospect and ignite the fire of challenge within them.

**Delivery Method: The Broken Talon Ritual
Time:** Between the 3rd and 4th bell past midnight

**Location:** The prospect‚Äôs apartment or shared dormitory at The Diddly

**Sequence of Delivery:**
1. **Silent Entry**	* Members of the Clawed Oath enter the apartment using **temporary phase glyphs**‚Äîshort-lived magical marks that allow them to slip through walls like mist. These glyphs leave no trace once the ritual is complete.
	* They never speak, never reveal their faces. They wear dark cloaks or glamouring spells that shroud their forms.
2. **The Marking of Territory**	* A clawed slash‚Äîjust shallow enough to score stone‚Äîis carved into the floor or wall *near the prospect‚Äôs bed*. It is always **three talon marks**, intersecting at a downward angle.
	* The slash glows faintly with arcane embers for 6 hours before fading.
3. **The Token**	* Placed on the pillow, desk, or center of the room is a **small obsidian claw**, about the size of a thumb, resting on a square of red cloth.
	* As soon as the prospect touches it, the claw **heats briefly** and then **disintegrates into ash**, triggering a minor illusion:
		* The air fills with the sound of a growl and the whispered phrase:
‚ÄúStrength is truth. Might is law. Come to the Obelisk.‚Äù

4. **The Flame Trail**	* After the claw dissolves, a **single arcane flame** appears floating just outside the window or doorway‚Äîvisible **only to the chosen**.
	* It slowly drifts toward the meeting point (the shattered Obelisk near the old dueling pits), pausing if the prospect falls behind.
	* It cannot be interacted with or diverted‚Äîif ignored, it disappears with a hiss at dawn.

**Notes for Prospects:**

* **No one else in the room will awaken** unless they are also prospects; the glyph includes a sleep-silencing field.

* Attempts to **scribe, record, or trace** the claw or flame magically fail. This reinforces the exclusivity and secrecy of the event.

* If the prospect refuses or shows cowardice, the society never contacts them again‚Äîand the mark of the claw fades as if it never was.

This method ensures that prospects are:

* Awed by the society‚Äôs reach and precision,

* Tested for courage and curiosity,

* Bound to secrecy by the sheer **weight of the ritual**.
Would you like an in-world ‚Äúincident‚Äù where one prospect disobeyed or tried to expose the invitation?

### **Traditions & Activities**

**1. The Tussle Nights** ‚Äì Weekly underground dueling events where members engage in bare-claw sparring. These bouts are a mix of ritual combat, training, and proving oneself before senior members.

### **The Society's Lair**
Hidden beneath the university‚Äôs **Hall of War**, the Clawed Oath‚Äôs meeting chamber‚Äî**The Eyrie of Might**‚Äîis a vast underground cavern adorned with ancient battle relics and carvings detailing past members‚Äô greatest victories. A mystical brazier at the center burns with an ever-present **blue and gold flame**, representing the unbreakable spirit of draconic warriors.

Only members know the secret entrance, which requires a specific claw formation pressed against a seemingly mundane wall of stone.

### **Symbol & Motto**

### **The Clawed Oath** *(Recited by Initiates During Induction)*

*"By fang and fire, by wing and might,*

*I swear upon my scales, my strength, my soul.*  

*Let the weak falter, let the timid flee‚Äî*  

*But I shall stand, unbroken, unbowed, unafraid.*  

*I am claw and storm, talon and wrath,*

*A scion of battle, a child of the sky.*  

*Honor is my law, power is my truth,*  

*And in the clash of combat, I am revealed.*  

*I pledge my wings to the Clawed Oath,*

*To my kin in struggle, my rivals in strength.*  

*I shall strike with courage, endure with pride,*  

*And never let fear rule my fire.*  

*Until my last breath, until my final roar,*

*I am bound by blood, by trial, by flame.*  

*Strength is truth. Might is law. Let my name be worthy."*  

*(Initiates then carve their claw mark into stone, symbolizing their entry into the ranks of the Clawed Oath.)*
