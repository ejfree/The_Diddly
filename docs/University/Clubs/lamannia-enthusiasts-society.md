# Lamannia Enthusiasts Society

At Dragon University, the *Lamannia Enthusiasts Society* AKA Lamas… is a thriving student-run club dedicated to the admiration and exploration of the primal forces and untamed beauty of the plane of Lamannia. The club attracts dragons who are drawn to the raw, unbound nature of the plane, its diverse fauna, and the pure, wild magic that it represents. They often host excursions to planar replicas, work with druids and shamans, and discuss Lamannia’s unique ecosystems and magical creatures.

### Officers of the *Lamannia Enthusiasts Society*:

1. **Elder Hydra: Swampclaw**
   A powerful green dragon who named themselves after the legendary Thunderclaw Tiger of Lamannia. Known for their deep knowledge of both flora and fauna, they often lead expeditions into Lamannia-inspired wildlands and teach other dragons the harmony between beast and nature.

2. **Elder Equinal: Tempestfang**
   This tempest dragon took their name from the ferocious Tempest Fang Wolf, an apex predator of Lamannia. They are fiercely devoted to preserving natural habitats and specialize in primal magics, often leading discussions on the natural balance of life and death in the wild.

3. **Elder Xorn: Mossmane**
   A peaceful cerulean dragon, Mossmane is named after the Mossmane Stag, a majestic creature said to be the guardian of Lamannia's deepest groves. Mossmane oversees the club's finances, ensuring that they have the resources to fund expeditions and environmental restoration projects.

4. **Elder Behir: Featherbreeze**
   A swift and elegant paradise dragon who took their name from the Featherbreeze Griffin, known for its grace in the air. Featherbreeze handles all the communication for the club, organizing meetings, and making sure that every dragon stays informed about upcoming events and seminars.

5. **Elder Rhemoraz: Roarkfang**
   This infernal dragon is named after the Roarkfang Serpent, a mythical beast of Lamannia known for its cunning and unpredictable nature. Roarkfang coordinates all the club's events, from plane-themed festivals to Lamannia-inspired survival challenges.

Together, these officers ensure that the *Lamannia Enthusiasts Society* continues to nurture the primal energy of the wild, attracting dragons who feel the call of nature’s untamed power.

Here are five members of the *Lamannia Enthusiasts Society* at Dragon University:

### 1. **Thornscale**
A young **emerald dragon** with an intense passion for Lamannia's vast jungles. Thornscale is particularly fascinated by the plane's massive plant life and often experiments with creating druidic magic that harnesses the raw power of nature. He enjoys spending his time in the University's botanical gardens, caring for rare plants and theorizing ways to communicate with them. Thornscale dreams of one day restoring devastated natural landscapes on other planes using Lamannian magic.

### 2. **Skyshadow**
A **shadow dragon** who loves observing and learning about the nocturnal creatures of Lamannia. Skyshadow feels a special kinship with the creatures of the night and often leads nighttime observation outings to study Lamannia’s more elusive beasts. Despite his affinity for shadow, Skyshadow believes in the balance between light and dark within nature and enjoys studying how the wilds function without interference.

### 3. **Rivercrest**
A **sea dragon** who feels at home in Lamannia's untamed rivers, lakes, and oceans. Rivercrest is passionate about aquatic ecosystems, and their fluid swimming style resembles the mythical Lamannian water serpents they admire. They are involved in preservation projects to protect the water-based environments both at Dragon University and in Lamannian replicas, frequently leading efforts to restore waterways and aquatic habitats across dimensions.

### 4. **Wildbriar**
An **forest dragon** who is deeply connected to the geological aspects of Lamannia, particularly its mountains and caves. Flinttail spends much of their time studying the primal energies that flow through the rocks and soil of the plane, often theorizing about how the natural forces of Lamannia can be harnessed to create new forms of magic. They have a personal goal to map out some of the uncharted mountain ranges within Lamannia’s wild terrain.

### 5. **Wildpyre**
A **red dragon** who is fascinated by the volcanic regions of Lamannia. Wildpyre feels a deep connection to the wildfires and volcanic eruptions that occur naturally on the plane, believing them to be an essential part of nature's destructive and regenerative cycle. Wildpyre is known for their enthusiasm in teaching others how nature recovers from devastation and believes that fire is a crucial element in maintaining the balance of life and death.

These five members bring their diverse interests and passions to the *Lamannia Enthusiasts Society*, adding depth and enthusiasm to the club’s exploration of the raw and untamed forces of nature.

In my dragon university, create a club that are fans of “Lamannia”, which is the plane of raw unbounded nature, filled with all sorts of plants, animals, and magical beasts. It should have 5 officers that are named after various beasts.
