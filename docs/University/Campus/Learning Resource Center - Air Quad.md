# Learning Resource Center - Air Quad


Location: Air Quad

Description:
30 story building made of gleaming white stone. It is octagonal however, ever floor up the towers is rotated 12 degrees.  There are also 30 floors below the surface, that follow the exact same pattern. The 15th floor is the sky lobby.


General Description: This is combination of study hall and library. Any student who needs help with class can attend free tutoring here. There are also stack of books, scrolls, audio recordings, illusory reproductions, and other media types. This place is deceptively huge. I would almost think of it as an iceberg with 90% “under the water” or hidden/displaced. It should be reachable via foot, but there would be LRC Addendums, which could hold special collections or restricted material that require flight.
