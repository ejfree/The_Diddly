# Treasure Hunters Anonymous THA


Perfect! Let’s build out **Treasure Hunters Anonymous (THA)** as a formalized, flamboyant counterpoint to the idea of secrecy—because of course, dragons can’t resist boasting.

**Treasure Hunters Anonymous (THA)**

*"The First Rule of Treasure Hunters Anonymous is: Tell EVERYONE about Treasure Hunters Anonymous."*

**Philosophy & Identity**

* **Opposite of anonymity:** Membership is public, bragged about, and often flaunted with extravagant displays of wealth. Members wear crests, pins, or jewelry marked with the THA sigil (a dragon’s claw clutching a glittering gem).

* **Horde mentality:** The club doubles as both a university chapter and part of a *much larger, multigenerational organization* spanning Argonnessen and beyond. Think of it as a cross between a mercenary guild, an explorer’s league, and a banking consortium, all tied together by the draconic obsession with treasure.

* **Core belief:** Treasure is meant to be sought, flaunted, and catalogued—not hidden. Sharing the story of how you got it is just as important as the treasure itself.

**Operation at Dragon University**

* **Chapter House:** Located in a cavernous, gem-encrusted annex off the main campus. Its walls are covered in illusions showing members’ greatest finds. Each dragon has a “brag plinth” where they showcase their most recent or proudest piece.

* **Meetings:** Weekly “Revelations,” where members present their latest acquisitions. They are judged not just on the treasure’s value, but on the drama of the story—how dangerous the dungeon was, how clever the trick to claim it, or how humiliating it was for the loser who lost it.

* **Ranks:**	1. **The Newly Gilded** – First-years or new initiates who must bring a “token” treasure to prove their worth.
	3. **Gemclaws** – Full members, recognized for having at least one truly worthy treasure.
	5. **Hoardmasters** – Senior members who manage collections, oversee rituals, and often “loan” artifacts to others for quests.
	7. **Auric Exemplars** – Alumni or legendary dragons who embody the club’s ideals and sometimes return to challenge students or sponsor expeditions.

**Wider Organization**

* **Network of Chapters:** Io’lokar, Argonnessen, and major cities across Eberron (Sharn, Korranberg, Stormreach). Each chapter maintains a **Catalogue of Claims**, a magical ledger that updates across all branches when someone records a treasure. This prevents disputes (and fuels them too).

* **Global Horde:** Members pledge that when they die, a portion of their hoard is willed to THA’s collective vault—an impossibly massive extradimensional treasury overseen by a consortium of ancient dragons. This both grows the prestige of THA and ensures younger members always have quests to chase.

* **Sanctioned Hunts:** The higher organization distributes rumors, maps, or even commissions expeditions for rare artifacts. Dragons compete furiously for these “Golden Leads.”

**Culture & Practices**

* **Ritual Boasts:** Every gathering ends with members lining up to “out-boast” one another in escalating tales. Exaggeration is expected; magical illusions often illustrate the stories.

* **Challenges:** Members are constantly trying to one-up each other by stealing, trading, or displaying flashier treasures. Theft *within the club* is technically forbidden—but “pranks” and “temporary acquisitions” are celebrated.

* **Brag Tokens:** When a member acquires something truly noteworthy, they mint a special coin or trinket inscribed with their sigil. These tokens circulate as status symbols across the student body.

**Reputation on Campus**

* Loud, proud, and flashy—often seen as gaudy by scholarly dragons, but secretly admired.

* Known for funding massive expeditions, campus parties where the decorations *are real treasure*, and occasionally sparking treasure hunts that spill into city streets.

* Faculty both groan at their antics and admire the discipline of their recordkeeping. The Dean of Ancient Relics and Artifacts (the brass dragon) often has “cordial conflicts” with THA about provenance and preservation.

**Adventure Hooks**
1. A **Golden Lead** surfaces about a relic tied to the Draconic Prophecy, and rival THA teams all rush to claim it.
4. A member’s treasure goes missing—was it stolen by another THA dragon, or something more sinister?
5. The **Global Catalogue of Claims** malfunctions, listing a student as the rightful owner of an artifact they’ve never seen before.
8. Rumor spreads of a **traitor chapter** that refuses to send its hoard-share to the vault, threatening the balance of the entire network.

Would you like me to **make a magical item** unique to THA membership (like a “Treasure Token” or “Brag Coin”) that reinforces the flaunting/bragging culture while still giving them a mechanical PF2e hook?
