# Sport Jai-lai + Lacross


Played in a Standard & Zero-g variant. This is played on a LARGE field by 6 dragons a side. There is 1 base, 2 or 3 of centers and wings. The field itself is actually an enclosed globe, where you can ricochet the ball to your teammate or in an attempt to score in the opponents goal.

You wear hurlers on your tail similar to Cuesta in a jai-lai game. In your hands you have 2 “paddles”, one black and one red. The red paddle will accelerate the ball. And the black paddle will slow down the ball, perhaps to redirect to a team mate, or a. More accurate shot.


Speed of ball levels up and makes aiming harder
Shoot gets a DC to save basically.
