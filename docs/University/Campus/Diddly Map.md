## Overview

The Depository of Interplanar Draconic Disciplines, Lore, Yield Surging, QUintessence , and Arcano-elemental and Techno Mechanics aka The Diddly is the premier draconic university across the known planes.

The campus is perfectly divided by the “leylines” into 4 elemental quadrants, one in each cardinal direction. The quadrants are as follows:

* North - Fire

* East - Air

* South - Water

* West - Earth

The center where the key lines meet is the famous arena, The Grand Ol’Diddly. It is a multifunctional magical arena that also houses the “Freshman aka Eggie” dorms. The area around the GOD is more campus like. But as it expands outward, it gets more elemental. Roads turn from representative colors to lava flows, cliffs, and rivers. Buildings also tend to follow the same design style. More collegiate & proper in the middle, then expanding outward to more chaotic and elemental designs.

## Central Locations

**0 - Grand Ol’ Diddly Amphitheater  -** The Eggy dorms surround the amphitheater. They all face outward. The freshman live on 5 floors in rooms that surround the arena. [https://housing.arizona.edu/dorms/navajo-pinal-stadium](https://housing.arizona.edu/dorms/navajo-pinal-stadium). Each room is a 20x20 space that the roomie can mold to their desires including environmentals. There are always 500 eggies in every 1st year class who need living spaces in the GOD. They are assigned to one of 20 wings. Each wing has 25 dragons and occupies a specific floor/quadrant of the Grand Ol’Diddley.

##

## <u>**Fire Quad - The North**</u>
This quad is the hottest of all three areas. The temperatures are always warm, with the heat level increasing as you eventually come to a pure lake of fire. At the center of this lake is portal to the Plane of Fire. It is a map location & guarded at all times by the “campus police”. It would have a volcano where it meets the earth quad out at the edge. Use lots of different lava & fiery floors. I think.

### Student & Faculty Resources

**(1) Raxplodox Gym** - AKA… The Rax. This is one of the foremost workout facilities in the universe. Stretching machines, training weights of all types, indoor courts or whatever you need is available. This facility is located at the juncture of the fire & earth quad and officially uses land in both quads. However, the gymnasium building itself is on the fire side exclusively as it was a donation from a Red Dragon Wyer.  There are connecting sports courts & fields that are located in the earth quad.

**(2) Horatio’s House of Healing & Wellness** - Not feeling yourself, come on it. Unless you are hungover from spending last night at the Grundle. If that is the case, just hydrate, as no one is casting restoration on you. Brought to you by the Horatio Family Weyr, they are THE prominent gold dragon weyr in argonessen. Staffed by member of that weyr as their annual “Weyr Duty”.

**Housing Locations**
These spaces are fiery, bold, having dramatic architecture with active magical "heat" elements.

Most housing locations have capacity for all classes with specific quotes set aside for drake, wyvern & primus.

* Sophmore/Drake Housing tends to be a shared common space for a flight of 5 dragons including a small kitchen, bathroom, & gathering area. Each dragon has an attached “portal” to their now 30x30 room which has multi zone environmental controls as well.

* Junior/Wyveryn tends to be a larger shared common space for a flight of 5 dragons including a small kitchen, bathroom, bonus area, indoor & outdoor gathering areas. Each dragon has an attached “portal” to their now 40x40 room which has multi zone environmental controls as well.

* Senior/Primus tends to be a much larger shared common space for a flight of 5 dragons including a large kitchen, 2 bathrooms, 2 bonus area, indoor & outdoor gathering areas. Each dragon has an attached “portal” to their now 50x50 room which has multi zone environmental controls as well.


**(6) Emberfall Heights** - Built into the actual lava flows there are terraced floors for all classes. The tower up the cliff with constant “lavafall”, one of which is real and prized by red dragons, and the others are illusions. There are constant warm breezes through open archways and the common spaces have ember-stone hearths as well as outdoor living spaces.

**(7) Cinderwalk Court** - Housing built along blackened basalt walkways. Magical torches always flicker with multicolored flame. There are also murals of ancient fire dragons and other similarly fire breathers decorate the walls.

**(8) Pyre Crest** - Buildings shaped like half-open dragon wings, "smoldering" with light reflecting from the surrounding lava. All heat is reduced, though there are several hot spots. The common areas feature central bonfire pits & heated pools for relaxing.

(**9) Crystalmount Rise** - Housing carved into a faux-volcanic “crystal” structure. Molten crystal channels flow through the decorative architecture. Very warm, cozy interiors designed for communal gatherings. Everything here is more dense & urban environments.

**(10) Ashspire Hollow** - Stone and dark wood construction rises high on the plateau, with softly glowing embers in every fixture. Enchanted ash swirling gently in courtyards. The entire plateau is hollow with the basement & penthouse being reserved for the Primus.

## <u>**Earth Quad - The West**</u>
This quad has the most diverse elevations of all three areas.  From the deep hole in the ground to the tallest mountains in the continent. The temperatures vary based on elevation and area.  There are forests, mines, canyons, hills, plateaus, and any other geological formation you can imaging.

### Student & Faculty Resources

**14) rewot terra** - This is a huge hole in the ground. It is between the middle of the earth quad and the Grand old diddly. Image it is like an inverted silo or downward tower. It goes to the center of the earth and evil things lie deep in the abyss. Students are prohibited from exploring past Level 172, which also happens to be the portal to the plane of earth. Campus police ensure compliance with access.

**(15) Sports Fields & Smaller stadium (15a)** - Accompany “the Rax” above, there are numerous sports fields and open spaces in this area. This includes an outdoor stadium, like a smaller HS football stadium, that is used for some events.

**(16) Main Administration Building** - It is integrated into the rewor terra as it occupies the western side of the hole. It contains all the administrative functions of the university including the chancellor’s office.

**(17) Druidic Circle -**  like stone henge. There is also a portal here to the Feywild. Again guarded against invasion.

**(18) Magic Forest** - A super magical forest where there is a portal to Lamania. It would be nearby the Feywild portal and guarded by the same group.

## <u>**Water Quad - The South**</u>
This quad is comprised only of water, with islands for any structure. Bridges connect the main campus to all the necessary locations in this quad. Some of the deeper reaches of this area are only reachable via flying or swimming. There are also significant underwater features including a portal to the elemental plane of water. Lots of water features in this space. Reefs, underwater trenches existing in this biome.

### Student & Faculty Resources

**(30) The Commons** - The student lounge,  main cafeteria for Eggies & Drakes, smaller dining rooms for  Wyverns & Primus. Special facility for faculty. This is where you receive mail

**(31) Symphonic Coliseum** - AKA SyCo (Psycho) Concert Hall for the Io’lokar Philharmonic as well as the university symphony and many other groups. It is one of the premier performance locations in the universe. It is done in a very avant garde and has over the top “dragon” theme  & culture.

**(32) Grimnosh Museum of Antiquities** - Similar in character to the Hermitage or the Louvre. This also has many magical artifacts from eras long past. Various art exhibits of all styles exist. In some cases and on some floors, they somewhat litter the place. The sub-basement floors are the holding place for a thousand’s of exhibits. None are of any real value. Those that are valuable are on loan from a horde and are embedded with trackers.


### Major Disciplines of Study

**(33) Grimnosh Annex** - Home to the major: Ancient Relics & Artifacts. This is next door, on the same island, as the Grimnosh Museum and shares the sub-basements.

**(34) The Institute for Advanced Arcanomechanics**- Home to the major: Arcanomechanics

**(35) Dominion Halls** - Home to the major: Economic Dominance and Resource Management

**Housing Locations**
Cool, flowing, reflective themes dominate.

**(36) Tidepool Grotto** - Housing wrapped around deep blue reflecting pools. There is soft bioluminescent lighting at night. Common rooms feature cascading fountains and soothing water sounds.

**(37) Mistwood Shoals** - Built into a tree from the earth zone that has grown like a mangrove into the Water Quad. The structures look woven from reeds and seaweed — strong but flexible. There is a mist in the area and the temperature can be controlled as desired, including wind levels.

(38) Pearl Current Row - Rounded, shell-like housing modules arranged along winding streams. Decorative walls of mother-of-pearl. Kitchens feature cold storage powered by elemental ice.

(39) Stormbay Landing - Bold, ship-themed housing anchored to faux-piers.
Rope bridges connect between blocks.
Occasional simulated thunderstorms for ambiance.

(40) Moonwater Falls - Housing is built into areas surrounding & behind a waterfall. The design is elegant white stone and silvered glass structures. Soft constant mist in the air gives a dreamlike effect. Some of the water pools in special "moon pools" in commons allow increased meditation.

## <u>**Air Quad - The East**</u>
This quad is comprised of sand, air, astral space, glass, and other odd construction materials desired. There are floating islands and connections to the astral plane and the plane of air in this quad as well. As others they are guarded against intrusion.  Much of this area is not available to Eggies who are not able to fly to the more remote locations.

### Student & Faculty Resources

**(44) Learning Resource Center** - This is combination of study hall and library. Any student who needs help with class can attend free tutoring here. There are also stack of books, scrolls, audio recordings, illusory reproductions, and other media types. This place is deceptively huge. I would almost think of it as an iceberg with 90% “under the water” or hidden/displaced. It should be reachable via foot, but there would be LRC Addendums, which could hold special collections or restricted material that require flight.

**(45) Facilities** - This is in a more remote location. It should not normally be accessed by students. Students would refer all problems to the ombudsman in the Commons. Even for a repair item, it would go through the commons.

### Major Disciplines of Study

**(46) Twins** - Home to the major: Planar Studies. Divided into 2 buildings and see if the design can play on the inner/outer adjectives used to divide the planes.

(**47) Chronicles of Eternity** - Home to the major: Dragon History. It is very close to the LRC. It has connected subbasements as well.

**(48) Halls of Enchantment** - Home to the major: Arcane Artifice and Enchantment Studies

**Housing Locations**
Light, floating, ethereal construction with constant breezes and open designs.

**(49) Zephyr Arcades** - Ribbon-like bridges connect towers that drift slightly in the air. Musical winds whistle soothing tunes through corridors. Common spaces are "open sky" themed including big glass domes.

**(50) Cirrus Vale** - Housing looks like spun silver clouds which are solidified. Walkways of semi-transparent mist. Elevator gusts (vertical wind currents) lift students between floors.

**(51) Galeholm Fields** - Wide, flat buildings with rooftop gardens. There are large and small breezeways through every structure. Feathered flags mark each flight’s residence.

**(52) Whirlwind Rise** - Spiral towers that spin slowly in place (very gently!) while overlooking to Fire Quad. Common areas have kinetic mobiles that shift with the air currents. Flights can customize wind-patterns for privacy or aesthetics.

**(53) Aetherwell Terrace** - Buildings perched on floating platforms tethered to the ground that even hang out into the fire quad. Slight bobbing sensation, like being on a ship in the sky.
