Overall: perfect, spot on. As I started added building identifiers, comments that I initially had changed dramatically. Here are. My notes, they are based on the area. I am also including a legend for how I see things. Overall, make the numbered building all a little larger. See if you can increase the scale factor and have them be a little more prominent

**Center - Grand Old Diddly (0)**
My main note is that every individual element should be centered; the square, pyramid, and ornament on top are not centered correctly. I love those colored circles though and how you have the rest of it setup. Should be stairs on the North, the same as the other directions. But I like the cliff and the elevation drop, so longer stairs. Or maybe a ramp/ramps. Or grand staircase.

**Fire Quadrant**
Overall - Can you make the ground darker & more “volcanic”. The closer areas should have a more basalt pavement look and feel and craggier towards edges. The colors should be more distinct black, cinder, fires. than the earth quad.

NE corner - Emphasize that crystal area in the NE. That is neat and could be all those versus rock cliff at the extreme end. Is there a crystal building maybe? That would be a cool addition.

Let’s add a building actually in lava area, I would assume this is probably a floating building or an island.

**Air Quadrant**
Love the oasis and the floating rocks. I like that special hexagon that is set apart, it can be larger.  Lets move some elements to use to upper & lower fringes of the area, specifically the housing. . It should be sparsely populated but still in use somewhat.

Add an Airship in the air quad. Again, fairly big as a building. Any look is fine, modern can be explained somehow.

<u>Air Quad Legend</u>
(20) Learning Resource Center -
(21) Facilities -
(22ab) Twins - Home to the major: Planar Studies (Quint). Divided into 2 buildings and see if the design can play on the inner/outer adjectives used to divide the planes.
(23) Chronicles of Eternity - Home to the major: Dragon History (Lore). It is very close to the LRC. It has connected subbasements as well.
(24ab) Halls of Enchantment - Home to the major: Arcane Artifice and Enchantment Studies (Yield)
+ Senior/Primus Housing as well and Junior/Wyvern housing.

**Water Quadrant**
There should be a boat here, a riverboat if possible. Let’s have an underwater structure with an accompanying small island above ground, near your existing “trench”. Essentially the entrance to an underwater environment that is home to (18) The arcano mechanics major.

Change the docks area to be the “student union” or “commons” area. Combine it with the smaller building that I noted at 14. That whole area should become the command. No need for the small boats, so no need for the docks in this area. But would be a relaxing beach area attached to the larger commons facility.

<u>Water Quad Legend</u>
(14) The Commons - **Need to add**
(15) Symphonic Coliseum - AKA SyCo (Psycho)
(16) Grimnosh Museum of Antiquities
(17) Grimnosh Annex - Home to the major: Ancient Relics & Artifacts (Lore) . This is next door, on the same island, as the Grimnosh Museum and shares the sub-basements.

(19) Dominion Halls - Home to the major: Economic Dominance and Resource Management (Yield)
Senior/Primus Housing.

**Earth Quadrant**
Should have mountains at the edge on the map on northwestern part and forest/heavy forest/unpeneatrable trees at the southwest edge on this quad. Should have a building built into the volcano also I think. Also, lets hang some sort of structure on the wall of the big hole.

<u>Earth Quad Legend</u>
