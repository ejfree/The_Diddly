Gambling Leader
Micky The Stick

* Gold Dragon majoring in Archanomechanics in the Wyvern Class - 4th Year.

* He runs all the action in the school. Carries a cricket bat with him

* However he does heal you after breaking bones with the cricket bat… and after you paid him.

* He is just a degenerate gambler. He will take action on anything.

* He is quite kind though  even though he will put a lien on your soul which if the debt is not repaid on death you will serve him for in his palace on Celestica Mountain.
