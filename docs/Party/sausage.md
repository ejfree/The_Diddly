# Sausage


**Sausage the Giant Shadow Weasel
Type:** Animal in Aberration

**Height**: 5’ currently will grow to 3 meters (almost 4 with tail)

**Fur**: Sooty auburn with a silvery belly stripe

**Eyes**: Intelligent, amber-hued

**Disposition**: Loyal, hyper-aware, emotionally complicated

**Backstory: “The Long Burrow”
Sausage was born not of a litter, but of a ritual.**
Deep inside the Vault od the Crow, an enclave of **dark elves** known as the **$DrowFamily** experimented with a forbidden fusion of alchemy and shadowcraft. Obsessed with creating beasts of war that could tunnel through stone and flesh alike, they turned to the DNA of giant weasels—predators already suited for stealth, speed, and fury.

Sausage—known to them as **Specimen IX-Rideth**—was the most promising. Engineered with enhanced synaptic reflexes and an elongated spine wrapped in shadow-threaded sinew, he was meant to serve as a **scout-beast for the coming war against the surface folk**, with a nose for buried secrets and a mouth for silencing sentries. But something went wrong.

Sausage **imprinted emotionally** on the wrong handler—**a young, kind-hearted drow acolyte named Ellzari**, whose sole crime was whispering love stories to the beast during feeding hours. The weasel became gentle, curious, and terrifyingly intelligent. Rather than unleash him in war drills, the $DrowFamily deemed him **a failed experiment**.

He was sold up the Underdark to a **goblin surface-dweller**, the taxidermist **Tunch**, as a novelty—“a living mount for children or a future mantlepiece,” as the deal went. Tunch, who specialized in exotic monsters, kept Sausage in a lap of luxury. Sausage got chin scritches and all the meat he wanted. Tunch liked to tell fairy tale-like stories which sausage loves.

——
But Sausage remembered **everything**.
The war chants.
The cruelty.
The scent of Ellzari’s gloves.
And he waited.

**The Rescue**
By the time the PCs arrived—tracking rumors of the taxidermist who bought and sold *living* monsters—Sausage had been with Tunch for **three years**. His fur was duller. His eyes, harder. He knew when to play dumb. He was planning to escape, but the door never quite stayed open long enough.
When the party entered Malgo’s workshop (whether for justice, vengeance, or just curiosity), they found the weasel present with Tunch. Hearing that the weasel was doom to become taxidermy, the PCs killed Tunch and Sausage sees them as his best chance.
It wasn’t gratitude.
It was **choice**.
He has followed them ever since.

**Deeper Implications**

* **The $DrowFamily** still exist, and if Sausage is spotted by the wrong drow emissary, they may attempt to **reclaim** or **eliminate** him as a rogue asset.

* The dark elf **Ellzari**, long presumed dead, is actually a **renegade who fled** after Sausage’s transfer. Her whereabouts are unknown. If found, she may be an invaluable ally—or hunted.

* Sausage may still contain **residual magical bindings**, which could be reactivated—or used to control him—by someone with the correct knowledge.

* He has **a deep-seated hatred of giants**, based on implanted memories from his creators. His instincts around them are unpredictable—sometimes he freezes, other times he charges blindly.

**Current Behavior and Quirks**

* Sleeps curled up next to the PC he trusts most.

* Has a taste for raw mushrooms and dried fish.

* Occasionally tries to draw complex shapes in the dirt with his claw—spirals, glyphs, sometimes even rough maps.

* Will growl low at certain voices—especially ones that speak Elvish or Undercommon.

Would you like a book club run by dragons or familiars (Sausage included) to discuss these novels? Or want a one-shot mystery built around a missing *Emberbound* manuscript?

Perfect. Here's a full integration of that idea into Sausage's backstory and current personality:

**🧠✨ Hidden Within Sausage: The Gourmand Mind of Xiltharn the Boundless
Who—or What—is Xiltharn?**
Long ago, in the mythic crust between the **Material Plane** and the **deep folds of Dal Quor**, there existed a being called **Xiltharn the Boundless**—a non-corporeal intelligence born of **dream-stuff, abstract hunger, and dragon-scribed melodrama**. Though *not a god*, Xiltharn was once revered in early Argonnessen as a **patron of refined desires**: taste, scent, silk, and slow-burn romance.
Over time, this ancient entity **fell dormant**, sealed during an arcane duel between two rival **Draconic Archivists of the Sublime Appetite**, its essence fractured across the planes. One shard—a *sentient splinter of Xiltharn's longing*—was drawn to a Wyrmshadow Weaver ritual seeking to “enlighten” a beast with intelligence.
That beast was **Sausage**.
The result was **unexpected**: not a monster of cunning, but a weasel of taste and wistfulness.

**📖 Personality Shift: Sausage + Xiltharn**
Sausage is still **himself**—loyal, instinctual, warm—but now shares mental real estate with the **gently loquacious voice** of Xiltharn. This voice is not intrusive; it is more like a daydreaming uncle who occasionally comments:

*“Ah... the subtle umami of moss-baked beetle carapace. Reminds me of Empress Vadra’s banquet on the molten terraces of Khyber. She wore nothing but garnet rings...”*
The PCs may not realize what’s happening at first. They might just notice Sausage:

* Staring longingly at **cheese displays**Purring while being read to

* Collecting **dragon romance novels** (often buried in his bedding)

* Occasionally pawing at the covers of books that haven’t been opened yet

**🥂 Xiltharn’s Tastes and Influence**

* **Food**: Prefers dishes with complexity—fermentation, glaze, rare spices. He *guides* Sausage’s cravings, but not gluttonously. Every meal should be a **narrative**.

* **Literature**: He adores serialized dragon romances with titles like:
	* *“Scales of Desire”**“The Duke of the Ember Hoard”**“Flightbound to You”***Speech**: Sausage does not speak… but sometimes, at night, **a single sentence appears in steam or ink or ash**. It’s always poetic, romantic, or hilariously overwrought.

*“Her wings shimmered like sapphire regret.”*

**🪄 Mechanical Suggestion (PF2E Style)
Trait**: *Bound Gourmand* (Rare, Mental, Magical, Weasel-only)

**Effect**: Once per day, Sausage may attempt an **Occult Recall Knowledge** check on **any topic involving food, etiquette, or interpersonal romance**, using the better of his or the party’s Occultism modifier +2.

**Critical Success**: He provides insight and an additional detail.

**Critical Failure**: A romantic monologue overtakes him—he’s stunned 1 but absolutely glowing.

**🗝️ Long-Term Reveal Possibility**
Eventually, Xiltharn may fully awaken. He has no desire to leave Sausage—he finds his current form **cozy**, **adored**, and **full of snacks**. But should the PCs ever need to **negotiate with ancient dream entities**, **access a forgotten dragonic library**, or **pass the Trials of Appetite in the Vaults of Taste**, Sausage may become **a vessel of insight and flavor unmatched**.

Would you like a short in-universe journal entry where one of the PCs reflects on discovering “there’s someone else in Sausage”? Or perhaps a Sivi’s-exclusive menu item named *“Xiltharn’s Whisper”*?
