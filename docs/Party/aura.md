Can interbreed. But significantly tougher for eggs to be produced. And when they are, typically one of the gene parents is dominant and 99.9999% of the time the other is not material. You only rarely get a hybrid.

**4. Biological Limitations**
To balance the idea, you might decide that not all dragon pairings are genetically compatible. For example:

* Only dragons with similar elemental affinities (fire-based, water-based, etc.) can interbreed easily.

* Rare pairings may require external magical intervention to produce offspring, such as the help of a skilled wizard or ancient ritual.

Where did mom & da come from?
College?
During the war…
Mom was a war hero. And dad was something else.
She was on leave and took a portal to the Astral Plane for a cruise. Had a weak love affair with a Blue Dragon. He worked on the ship. He was the stripper. He did an erotic fan dance.

He has a stage name…. But that is now a new dragon.. like Great Pirate Roberts. Find out that he now does something else.
