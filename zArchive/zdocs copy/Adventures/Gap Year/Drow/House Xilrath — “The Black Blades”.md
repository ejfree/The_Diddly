This makes House Xilrath the **largest single fighting force in the city** — enough to anchor the war against the surface.

👉 Do you want me to build **encounter-sized subgroups** (e.g., what a “Black Blade patrol” of 8–10 looks like, what a 50-soldier raiding company looks like in PF2e terms)? That way you can drop them into your sessions without having to scale from the full TOE.


Perfect — let’s build **House Xilrath** into a PF2e–ready organization. Since this house is the **militaristic “matron house”**of your Underdark city, I’ll sketch its structure like a faction/army with role-tiers you can pull NPCs from.

## **House Xilrath (PF2e Organization)**

**Theme**
A Lolthite war-house that has spent two decades preparing for a surface war. Obsessed with discipline, military strength, and logistics. Their estates are half-fortress, half-temple.

**Hierarchy (by Tier)
Matron Mother (Lvl 15–17 Boss)**

* **Role:** Supreme authority, priestess of Lolth, directs both war and house politics.

* **Statblock Base:** Drow Priestess of Lolth (Bestiary 2) adjusted to Lvl 16–17; add Leadership aura, Divine Sorcerer bloodline (Divine/Occult mix).

* **Signature Abilities:** Command Underdark, Lolth’s Wrath (Divine Punishment, high-level debuffs), battlefield control magic.

**High Priestesses / Commanders (Lvl 11–13)**

* **Role:** Each controls a war-wing (roughly 500 troops).

* **Statblock Base:** Drow Priestess of Lolth or Cleric archetype; Warpriest build.

* **Abilities:** Divine wrath, healing, Inspire fanaticism, mass fear effects.

* **Numbers:** 3–4, each directly tied to a branch (infantry, scouts, logistics, temple).

**Weapon Masters / Warmages (Lvl 8–10)**

* **Role:** Lead strike groups of 50–100. One per unit.

* **Statblock Base:** Drow Warrior Captain (Bestiary 2) with Fighter or Wizard dedication depending on role.

* **Abilities:** Martial tactics, spell support (if mage).

* **Numbers:** 10–15 total.

**Elite Soldiers (“House Guard”) (Lvl 5–7)**

* **Role:** Shock troops, bodyguards, and special squads.

* **Statblock Base:** Drow Fighter (Lvl 5) or Elite adjustments; can mix in Champion or Rogue archetypes.

* **Abilities:** Darkness tactics, poisoned weapons, advanced combat maneuvers.

* **Numbers:** ~200

**Common Soldiers / Retainers (Lvl 2–4)**

* **Role:** Rank-and-file house warriors, the bulk of the army.

* **Statblock Base:** Drow Warrior (Lvl 2) with trained martial proficiencies.

* **Abilities:** Poisoned bolts, coordinated ambushes, Darkvision tactics.

* **Numbers:** ~1,200

**Slaves & Auxiliaries (Lvl –1 to 2)**

* **Role:** Quaggoths, kobolds, goblins, rothé herders. Used for fodder, manual labor, or cannon-fodder.

* **Statblock Base:** Quaggoth Brute (Lvl 3), Goblin Warrior (Lvl 1), Kobold Scout (Lvl –1).

* **Numbers:** 1,500–2,000

**House Specialization (Mechanical Hooks)**

* **Faction Benefit:** House Xilrath units gain **Darkness Maneuvers** — fighting inside magical darkness grants them +1 circumstance bonus to attack rolls vs flat-footed enemies.

* **Tactics:** Always fight in layered formations: poisoned skirmishers up front, clerical support behind, and quaggoth shock troops at the flanks.

* **Weakness:** Over-reliance on strict chains of command. If leaders are disrupted, morale falters quickly.

**Adventure Hooks**

* PCs may face **Lvl 5–7 strike squads** (one Warmage, 6–8 Elite Soldiers).

* A **forward raid** could be led by a Lvl 11–12 Commander with 50 troops.

* The **House Fortress** is defended by hundreds of soldiers, but the Matron rarely leaves her sanctum.

👉 Do you want me to also design the **House Xilrath Fortress (estate/compound) keyed to the D3 noble estate map**, so you can drop in where the garrisons, temples, and command halls are? That would give you a physical place to stage intrigue or an assault.

## **House Xilrath — “The Tyrant Blades” (Reconciled TOE)**

**Grand Total:** **1,550** (**Drow 650** + **Auxiliaries 900**)

**Drow Personnel — 650 total**

* **Command (3):** Matron, First Blade (War Captain), Shadow Seneschal

* **Temple/War-Priest Cadre (35)****Blade Cohorts (300):** heavy infantry (spears, shields, glaives)

* **Void-Archers (120):** hand crossbows, poisoned bolts

* **Skirmishers/Scouts (80):** outriders, pursuit teams

* **Engineers/Sappers (40):** collapses, bridgework, firepots

* **Logistics/Quartermasters (72):** armorers, medics, scribes

**Math check:** 3 + 35 + 300 + 120 + 80 + 40 + 72 = **650**

**Auxiliaries — 900 total**

* **Merc Goblins (240):** shield-pushers, javelins

* **Kobold Sappers (90):** traps & firebombs

* **Thrall Porters/Laborers (220):** mixed races

* **Pack Lizards & Mules (140)****Quaggoth Shock (80)****Giant Spiders (40)****Siege Crew (40):** ogre teamsters and riggers

* **Handlers (50):** non-drow hirelings attached to beasts

**Math check:** 240 + 90 + 220 + 140 + 80 + 40 + 40 + 50 = **900**

**Doctrine:** anvil (Blades) + hammer (Quaggoths) under covering poison volleys.

**Weakness:** if Void-Archers are neutralized, advances stall.
