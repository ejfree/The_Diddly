Perfect — here’s your **Council of Houses** roster for the drow war-city. This is modeled on the *Ruling Council* of Menzoberranzan but tuned for your **two-decade war effort** and the political weight of each house’s military company.


## Council of Houses

### Structure

- **Seats:** 6 total (2 major houses, 4 minor).

- **Voting Power:** Weighted by house status and military contribution.
	- Major Houses: 2 votes each
	- Minor Houses: 1 vote each

- **Council Hall:** A circular obsidian chamber inside the Temple-Fortress of Lolth, with each house’s insignia carved into stone thrones.

- **Council Stance:** Favors aggressive assaults — release beasts first to sow chaos

- **Allies:** Xilrath (military needs beasts)

- **Rivals:** Velouryn (mercantile types seen as weak)

#### House Thalmyr (1 vote)

- **Faction Role:** Espionage and assassinations

- **Matron Mother:** Lythrae Thalmyr — pragmatic spymistress

- **Military Company:** The Silent Blades (150 assassins, spies, scouts)

- **Council Stance:** Prefers subtle infiltration before open war; urges restraint until assassins weaken surface leaders

- **Allies:** Plays both sides — sells secrets to Veythrae and Xilrath

- **Rivals:** Zhaelor (zealots often uncover spies)

#### House Velouryn (1 vote)

- **Faction Role:** Wealth and contraband

- **Matron Mother:** Ulvrae Velouryn — the purse-strings of the city

- **Military Company:** The Venom Syndicate (60 enforcers, 40 alchemists, 200 mercs)

- **Council Stance:** Advocates prolonged preparation, prefers covert smuggling routes and resource accumulation

- **Allies:** Veythrae (funds their research), Thalmyr (buys intel)

- **Rivals:** Dravun (calls them “beast-brutes”), Zhaelor (inquisitors target their smuggling)

#### House Zhaelor (1 vote)

- **Faction Role:** Fanatical religion

- **Military Company:** The Lash of Lolth (100 zealots, 30 clerics, 150 indoctrinated slaves)

- **Council Stance:** Pushes for holy war now; views hesitation as heresy

- **Allies:** Xilrath (war doctrine, at least superficially)

- **Rivals:** Veythrae (sees them as dangerously heretical)


## Council Dynamics

- **Xilrath + Zhaelor + Dravun (4 votes):** Favors immediate war through attrition and terror

- **Veythrae + Velouryn + Thalmyr (4 votes):** Favors delayed war to build more magical, economic, and espionage advantages

- **TIE-BREAKERS:** Lolth’s High Priestess (neutral, outside the houses) sometimes casts the deciding vote, keeping the balance precarious

⚖️ This creates a 4 vs 4 split — meaning intrigue, assassination, or divine intervention often decides votes. Perfect for adventure hooks.

Would you like me to key each house’s estate onto your D3 map so you know their physical placement (who’s neighbors, who’s isolated)? That’ll tie the politics to geography and make betrayal/intrigue even sharper.
