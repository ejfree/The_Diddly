# Map Info


Excellent — using the **Menzoberranzan maps from** ***D3: Vault of the Drow*** gives you a strong backbone. Here’s how you can **re-skin and adapt that layout** to your new Eberron-flavored war city, while keeping the FR Underdark feel intact:

**City Overview**

* **Population:** ~12,000 drow + 5,000 thralls/slaves.

* **Tone:** Heavily militarized forward-base city. Rather than the sprawling decadence of Menzoberranzan, this one is a knife pointed at the surface world.

* **Centerpiece:** A towering **Temple-Fortress of Lolth**, doubling as war council hall and reliquary.

**Districts (Mapped to D3 Features)
1. The Noble Plateau**

* Equivalent to the noble districts in Menzoberranzan.

* Here sit the **two great houses (Xilrath & Veythrae)**, massive stalactite/column complexes with hanging bridges.

* The **four minor houses** cluster nearby, slightly lower in elevation, constantly reminded of their lesser rank.

* **Clue to war focus:** barracks and weapons forges integrated into noble estates instead of pure luxury.

**2. The Lower Warrens**

* Adapted from Menzoberranzan’s commoner quarters.

* Dense cavern neighborhoods for artisans, soldiers’ families, and laborers.

* **Hidden tunnels:** Thalmyr maintains bolt-holes and hidden passageways here for their spies.

**3. The Slave Pens**

* Expanded compared to FR models — because this city is war-minded.

* Quaggoths, goblins, kobolds, duergar, and captured surface folk are kept in regimented pens.

* **Dravun’s beast pits** link here, where spiders, cave lizards, and rothé are trained for war.

**4. The Great Market**

* Much like Menzoberranzan’s Bazaar, but with **Velouryn dominance**.

* Exotic poisons, enchanted weapons from House Veythrae, slaves, fungus-based food, surface contraband.

* Whispered deals with duergar and possibly smugglers from Khyber.

**5. The Temple-Fortress of Lolth**

* Massive, central feature — carved into a stalagmite cluster, with bridges spanning to stalactites above.

* Serves both as a **holy site** and a **command citadel**.

* Houses the **High Priestess Council**, where Houses Xilrath and Zhaelor clash for religious dominance.

* **Architecture:** looming spider motifs, hanging cages of sacrifices, obsidian altar chamber.

**6. The War Tunnels**

* Unique addition compared to Menzoberranzan.

* A fortified network of caverns leading upward toward the surface.

* Guard towers, ambush chambers, and choke points line the way.

* The staging ground for assaults — soldiers bivouac here, drilling constantly.

**7. Academy of Shadowfire**

* Equivalent to Sorcere in Menzoberranzan, but **Veythrae-controlled**.

* Half wizard-academy, half war laboratory.

* Demonic binding pits, shadowforges, and testing grounds for experimental spells.

* Apprentices double as expendable “shock mages.”

**Flavor Differences from Menzoberranzan**

* **Less decadence, more discipline.** Streets are patrolled heavily, curfews exist, and soldiers drill openly.

* **The surface war looms.** Every district has signs of mobilization: food stockpiles, war banners, priests preaching conquest.

* **Paranoia at home.** Noble houses plot against each other, but none dare sabotage the war effort outright… yet.

Would you like me to **mark out where each of your six houses’ estates** would go on the D3 map (so you can overlay their territories)? That way you’ll know who neighbors who, which is often the seed for intrigue and betrayal.
