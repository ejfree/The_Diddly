# Moon Petal Circlet


Here’s a fully Pathfinder 2E–compatible elven relic that starts at **Level 6** and can scale in power as the PCs grow. I designed it with PF2E relic mechanics in mind, including **Gifts**, **Awakenings**, and **Relic Powers**, so you can drop it into your campaign seamlessly.

**Moonpetal Circlet**

*Relic, Unique, Divination, Transmutation*

**Item Level**: 6 (scales with awakenings)

**Bulk**: — (worn)

**Usage**: worn headband

**Description**
This delicate circlet of woven mithral vines and luminous moonpetals was crafted by ancient elven seers of the Verdant Spire. It resonates with moonlight and whispers of distant futures, protecting its wearer and guiding them toward fate’s hidden paths.
The circlet bonds to its wearer as a **Relic** (GMG 89). It gains power when the wearer completes significant story milestones tied to elven heritage, moonlight, or uncovering forgotten prophecies.

**Base Gift (Level 6)
Moon’s Insight (Focus Power, 1 Focus Point)**

*Divination, Fortune*

**Cast**: 1 action

**Frequency**: Once per 10 minutes

**Effect**: You call on the wisdom of the moon. Roll twice and take the better result on your next Perception check or skill check involving Recall Knowledge before the start of your next turn.

* **Focus Point Pool**: Starts at 1 point, increases with awakenings.

* **Recharge**: Focus points recharge as normal via Refocus.

**First Awakening (Level 8)
Gift: Moonlit Veil**

* Gain *Darkvision* (or *Greater Darkvision* if you already have Darkvision).

* While in dim light or darkness, you gain a +1 item bonus to Stealth checks.

**Relic Power Upgrade**: *Moon’s Insight* now also applies to your next saving throw if unused on a skill/perception check within 1 round.

**Second Awakening (Level 10)
Gift: Lunar Resilience**

* Gain resistance 5 to negative damage and resistance 5 to mental damage while in dim light or darkness.

* You can cast *Moonlight Ray* as a **1st-rank innate spell** once per hour.

**Focus Power Upgrade**: *Moon’s Insight* now lasts until the end of your next turn, affecting all eligible rolls within that duration.

**Third Awakening (Level 12)
Gift: Fate’s Eclipse**

* Once per day, you can enter a **Moonshadow State** for 1 minute:
	* Gain *concealment* while in dim light or darkness.
	* Enemies must succeed at a DC 5 flat check to target you directly.

**Focus Pool Upgrade**: Gain a second Focus Point.

**Fourth Awakening (Level 14)
Gift: True Seer of the Moon**

* Cast *True Seeing* once per day as an innate spell.

* *Moonlight Ray* becomes a 4th-rank spell when cast through the circlet.

* While Refocusing under the moonlight, regain 2 Focus Points instead of 1.

**Fifth Awakening (Level 16)
Gift: Moon’s Apotheosis**

* Permanently gain *Greater Darkvision* and constant *See Invisibility*.

* Once per day, you can use **Moon’s Judgment**:
	* As a 3-action activity, call down a beam of pure moonlight in a 20-foot radius, dealing 10d6 positive damage to undead and fiends (basic Reflex save, DC = highest spell DC or class DC). Allies in the area heal 5d6 Hit Points.

If you want, I can create **full PF2E stat blocks** for the Focus Powers and relic effects so they’re ready to drop into Foundry or your campaign notes.
Do you want me to build out the **complete PF2E rules text** for this relic? It would be copy-paste ready for play.
