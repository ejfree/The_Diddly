New Year’s Adventure

### PF2e Adventure: "The Shimmering Eve at the Emerald Dragon Weyr"

**Adventure Level:** 2nd Level

**Player Characters (PCs):** 4 Player Characters  

**Setting:** Winter Break, New Year's Eve  

**Location:** Emerald Dragon Weyr, a home of Lisa (Emerald Dragon RA)  

---

#### **Adventure Overview:**

The PCs are invited by Lisa, the RA from Dragon University, to spend winter break with her at the Emerald Dragon Weyr, located in a secluded mountain area surrounded by lush forests and frozen lakes. As the night of New Year's Eve approaches, the PCs are offered an opportunity to experience a unique tradition of the Emerald Dragon Weyr — a gathering of ancient draconic powers that resonates with the passing of time. But just as the celebration begins, something goes wrong. The PCs are accidentally teleported to a mysterious location, and must work together to solve the riddle of their new environment before they can return home.

---

#### **Introduction:**

Lisa, an eager and friendly 2nd-year emerald dragon student, invites the PCs to her home during winter break. The Emerald Dragon Weyr is a breathtaking, mystical place nestled within a forested mountaintop. The weyr itself is composed of natural emerald-hued caves that shimmer in the moonlight, and the surrounding landscape is a winter wonderland filled with snow-covered trees, frozen lakes, and glowing crystals.

Lisa's family, composed of emerald dragons, hosts an annual New Year’s Eve ceremony. The family believes in the merging of the natural world with draconic magic to ensure harmony and prosperity for the coming year. For the night, they open their doors to the few select guests they trust, offering a magical feast, storytelling, and a chance for the guests to experience draconic traditions.

However, during the evening’s rituals, something disrupts the magic, and the PCs are suddenly pulled away into another plane of existence.

---

#### **Adventure Hook:**

After a warm greeting and a cozy meal at the Emerald Dragon Weyr, Lisa leads the group to a large hall deep within the weyr. There, the family prepares a ritual to honor the turning of the year. The PCs are given the opportunity to participate in the ritual, which involves stepping into a shimmering, enchanted circle while Lisa's family channels draconic magic to honor the flow of time.

As the PCs stand in the circle, the magical ritual unexpectedly goes haywire. A flash of emerald light and a loud crackling sound fill the room, and suddenly, the world around the PCs goes dark.

---

#### **Act 1: A Strange New Year**

The PCs awaken in a new, unfamiliar location: a fog-shrouded forest, dimly lit by eerie, shifting lights that seem to move like will-o'-wisps. The air is unnaturally cold, but there’s no snow. The trees are large and gnarled, their branches twisted into unnatural shapes. The ground is soft and spongy, and the atmosphere is thick with an ominous silence.

In this strange place, the PCs must figure out where they are, how to escape, and what caused their unexpected displacement.

**Key Points:**

- **Investigation:** The PCs can examine their surroundings to learn about the strange environment. Skill checks (Nature, Occultism, Arcana, etc.) will help the players discern that they’ve been transported to a plane that mirrors aspects of the Feywild or a dreamlike space.

- **Mysterious Figure:** A figure cloaked in shimmering mist suddenly appears before the PCs. This enigmatic figure claims to be a guardian of the lost spaces between planes. He hints that something disturbed the ritual back at the Weyr, and the PCs must solve the riddle of this dimension before they can return.

---

#### **Act 2: Trials of the Shimmering Path**

The mysterious figure tells the PCs that the only way to return to the Emerald Dragon Weyr is by completing three trials — each representing a different aspect of draconic power: **Time**, **Strength**, and **Cunning**.

1. **Trial of Time:**
   The PCs must solve a riddle tied to the passage of time. They are presented with a massive, enchanted hourglass that seems to run backward. They must reverse the flow of time in the hourglass by solving a series of puzzles based on historical events related to dragons or the Feywild.

   **Skill Challenge:** The PCs can use Arcana, History, or Lore skills to decipher symbols or interpret magical phenomena. Failure results in the hourglass slowing further and summoning time-warped creatures (like time-frozen animals or creatures with unnatural aging effects).

2. **Trial of Strength:**
   A stone golem made of frozen mist and rock challenges the PCs to a contest of strength. The golem is resistant to normal attacks and uses ice-based powers that grow stronger in the cold. The players must either use brute strength or creative tactics (like fire-based magic or spells that manipulate the environment) to defeat the golem.

   **Combat Encounter:** This encounter requires the PCs to utilize environment-based tactics (fire, heat, or agility) to defeat the golem. Additionally, the golem can challenge individual players to strength contests (based on Athletics or other physical skills).

3. **Trial of Cunning:**
   A labyrinth of twisting illusions appears before the PCs, where the walls constantly shift, and the path forward is unclear. The PCs must navigate this maze using their wits, discerning which paths are real and which are illusions. The maze is full of traps, and the players must avoid pitfalls or solve riddles presented by strange creatures that lurk within.

   **Skill Challenge:** Players may use Perception, Diplomacy (to talk their way past illusions), or Thievery (to disable traps) to navigate. They may also use magical abilities to reveal hidden pathways. Each failed attempt could lead to a trap or illusion that brings them closer to a dangerous creature.

---

#### **Act 3: The Return**

Once the trials are completed, the guardian reappears and reveals that the final piece of the puzzle lies in understanding the true meaning of the ritual back at the Emerald Dragon Weyr. He offers a chance for the PCs to speak with him in their final moments in this plane, giving them crucial insight into their situation.

As the PCs solve the riddle and unlock the final clue, a portal opens, and they return to the Emerald Dragon Weyr just as the clock strikes midnight. The family, including Lisa, greets them with joy, and they have successfully completed their unexpected journey. However, the guardian’s parting words will linger in their minds: the disturbances in the ritual may be a sign of something far more dangerous.

---

#### **Final Scene: New Year’s Eve Celebration**

As the PCs return just in time to witness the New Year’s celebrations, Lisa and her family greet them warmly. The traditional festivities — singing, storytelling, and feasting — take place, with an air of mystery and celebration of the passing year.

However, Lisa warns the group that the strange happenings during the ritual may be a prelude to something larger. It is up to the PCs to decide what their next steps will be — uncovering the mysteries behind the Feywild-like disturbances and what they may portend for Dragon University and beyond.

---

#### **Optional Encounters and Twists:**

1. **Revelation:** After the PCs return, Lisa's father — an ancient emerald dragon — tells them that the ritual disturbance was not an accident. There are whispers of a growing force attempting to disrupt the magic of draconic traditions across the world.

2. **Artifact of Power:** A magical artifact discovered during the trials may be useful in the future. The artifact could be an ancient trinket, a crystal shard that the PCs must keep safe until they understand its significance.

3. **Secrets of the Guardian:** The guardian who aided the PCs during the trials may secretly be more than he seems — perhaps an agent of a hidden draconic faction or an ancient being with its own motives.

This adventure provides the players with a mix of investigative, skill-based challenges, combat, and exploration while also weaving in thematic elements of draconic traditions and mystery. The timeline around New Year’s Eve creates an exciting backdrop for unexpected events.
