# Dragon Tussling - Diddly Ladders


Always Year focused. Mainly because of the skill gap between 4 levels. Upon graduation you would challenge into tier 10. You have to beat someone to get on the list. Any people over the 500 mark are removed from “professional” tracking. Gambling is allowed and sanctioned, however players can not gamble after the Roger & Stem incident.
