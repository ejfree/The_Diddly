#### Prophecy

- **Dean Blackshard (Infernal Dragon):** Specializes in interpreting dark prophecies and their implications for dragonkind.

This infernal dragon, named Blackshard, embodies a formidable and awe-inspiring presence. Towering and robust, with an aura that seems to ripple the air around them, Blackshard black scales aren't just reminiscent of molten lava that has solidified into rock —they appear as though actual flames course beneath them, giving off a soft, ominous glow that illuminates their surroundings in a dim, reddish light. This visual effect intensifies whenever they speak, especially when discussing matters of grave importance or dark prophecy. Draw it

As the Dean of Prophecy at the College of Lore, Blackshard is not only an expert in divination but also a scholar of ancient and forbidden texts. Their office is filled with scrolls and tomes that are centuries old, some of which are believed to be the only copies in existence. Blackshard is particularly fascinated by the cyclical nature of history and uses their knowledge to draw parallels between past catastrophes and potential future events.

Their role at Dragon University isn't just academic; it's also deeply political. Blackshard advises the university's council and other influential figures within the dragon community, providing guidance that is often pivotal in decision-making processes. Despite their somewhat intimidating demeanor, Blackshard is deeply respected and even revered, as many believe that their foresight has spared the dragon community from numerous threats.

Blackshard also mentors a select group of students, teaching them the art of scrying, the interpretation of omens, and the ethical implications of using such knowledge. These students are chosen for their potential and resilience, as the path of a prophet is fraught with burdensome truths and moral dilemmas.
