His research primarily focuses on how different environments affect both flora and fauna across the planes, emphasizing the interconnectivity and ecological balance necessary for sustaining life.

**Personality:**
Viridius is deeply intellectual and has a keen interest in conservation and ecological studies.

**Goals:**
Viridius aims to expand the knowledge of planar ecology among the dragon community, hoping to foster a generation of dragons who are as concerned with the preservation of natural balances as they are with their own growth and power.

This character can serve as an excellent guide or mentor for player characters who are interested in planar travel, ecological studies, or simply seeking wisdom from a seasoned scholar.
