Here is the updated student NPC profile for Roarkfang:

---

**Name**: Roarkfang

**Dragon Type**: Infernal  

**Year**: 5th Year, Primus  

**Major**: Political Intrigue  

### Personality:
Roarkfang is cunning and strategic, often observing before making their move in any situation. They have a sharp mind and a natural talent for reading people, making them highly skilled in political maneuvering. Despite their infernal heritage, they are not overtly intimidating; instead, they use subtlety and charm to influence others. Roarkfang is fiercely independent and values personal space but can be incredibly loyal to those they trust. In their primus year, they are known as a master of manipulation, always thinking several steps ahead in every interaction.

### Description:
Roarkfang's scales are a deep, dull crimson with a faint shimmer of obsidian along the edges, giving them a smoky, almost molten appearance. They have sharp, angular horns that curve slightly back, framing their narrow, fox-like face. Their eyes glow faintly with an ember-like intensity, adding to their enigmatic presence. Though they aren’t physically large for a dragon, their aura carries a quiet intensity that commands attention. Their wings have a tattered look, as if singed at the edges, though they function perfectly well.

### Room Details:
Roarkfang’s dorm room is dimly lit, reflecting their preference for shadows and subtlety. The walls are a deep charcoal gray, adorned with maps of political territories, ancient texts, and diagrams of power structures. The room is tidy but has a distinctly personal touch with infernal runes glowing faintly around the edges, casting a soft, eerie red glow. Their furniture is minimalist—dark wooden shelves filled with books, a simple bed with dark crimson sheets, and a writing desk cluttered with parchment and ink. A faint smell of sulfur lingers in the air, a reminder of their infernal nature.
