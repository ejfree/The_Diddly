# City Location Breakout


There are 6 levels to Io’Lokar

L1: Shops, General Portals, and most taverns, inns and everything is located on this level.
L2 - This level holds all the general governmental buildings and a very small number of food/inns.
L3 - Library Level - Research Houses & Libraries. There are a very few shops on this level and all specific to books & scholarly things.
L4 - L6 are housing. This is fairly dense as there is a lot of space fuckery going on inside. Every weyr has a townhouse location on level 4 & 5. Level 6  is more estates for some of the larger weyrs.
