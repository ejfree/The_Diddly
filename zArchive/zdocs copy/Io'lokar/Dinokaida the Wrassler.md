# Dinokaida the Wrassler


Kaida is a  ancient copper dragon who sounds exactly like Randy the Macho man savage. He is a professional “tussler” and is currently the #1 ranked “tussler” in the Dragon Universe. He also runs a training gym in Io called  Tusslers Square. At night the training gym turns into a bar. And there is still a ring up if anyone chooses to wrassle.

It is next door to The Viridian Salon, which is the finest place for high tea in the continent. Lots of private rooms available. His college “fling” & current girlfriend, Alyssa Siviridon, emerald dragon, matriarch of the entire Emerald Weyr owns this resteraut. They were recently reunited by a band of adventurers working for the Trust.

Dinokaida’s soul was

	Cocktails & canapés in the evening. Close at 7:30 to make the show.

Dinokaida DaggerToe Drop is his signature move.

This ancient copper dragon, as the owner and instructor of a wrestling gym, probably has a lot of charisma and toughness. His scales might have a deep, metallic copper sheen, and given his athleticism, he would have a very muscular build with powerful limbs—perfect for demonstrating wrestling techniques. His gym might be adorned with medieval-style training equipment, and his presence could be both inspiring and a bit intimidating to his trainees.

In my dragon university, imaging an ancient copper dragon who runs a wrestling gym. He is a very buff and athletic dragon.
