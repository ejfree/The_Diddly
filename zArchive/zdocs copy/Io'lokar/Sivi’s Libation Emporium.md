# Sivi’s Libation Emporium


Run by Alyssa Siviridion. It is per personalized version of the Sivis Stop concept, but no communications. They serve beverages of any sort, though not intoxicants at the branch cafes. Those are sold at the main location in Io. However, she surely doesn’t listen in on conversations again… Does she?

It is run by a huge automated samovar. This samovar has an animated illusion interface. The illusion appears to be a gnome. As your drink is made, you can see the small portals that open to the elemental planes of Fire and Water to make sure everything is the purest possible.
