Vortex Dragon masquerading as a gnome. However he does have a lot of blue tattoos on his pale yellowy but not jaundiced.

Jabbie is all about exploring food and the cuisines of the local area, however he is a voracious snacker and world renown chef. He has studied with the best in the world and once had their own small restaurant in Korranberg.

abbie sounds like a fantastic character! As a vortex dragon with such unique features, he must bring a magical touch to his culinary creations. His blue body decorated with yellow whorls makes him quite striking. Working as a chef in a 5-star restaurant, Jabbie probably uses his dragon abilities to craft dishes that are not only delicious but also visually spectacular. What kind of dishes do you think he specializes in? Maybe something that plays with fire or incorporates elements of air, fitting for a vortex dragon?
