“Secrets”:
There will be a seminar by a visiting scholar and I would like to be the first to announce, Guest Lecturer Alyssa Siviridion.
Much of this information has been classified for the past 25 years.
	1. The Mourning was intentional set off by the dragon. It was meant to eliminate a very dark part of the prophecy
	2. The decision at the time was based on multiple sources, including secret messages, which were decoded, as well as  intelligence sources.
	3. She is releasing this background as part of her research. She has every message from everywhere and everyone.
	4. Cyre had create a weapon which would not only kill the undead hordes of Thrane, but would also reduce Sharn & Breland to ash. The follow on impact to the rest of the world would be equally alarming
	5. The mourning elegantly saved the world at the expense of a few agressive humans.
	6. Even had to revise my paper. Recently acquired evidence of Cyrean plans show further proof their intent and ability.
