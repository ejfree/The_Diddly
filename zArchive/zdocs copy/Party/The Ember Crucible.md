# **Relic: The Ember Crucible**

*Level 6 Relic (scales with PC)*

**Appearance**
A palm-sized black crucible bowl, rimmed in bronze, that always feels faintly warm. When reagents are poured in, a thin ember-glow lights the inside even if no fire is present. The crucible whispers softly in Goblin about formulas, perfection, and “the true elixir.”

**Base Relic Powers**

* **Attuned to Alchemists**: Only an alchemist can properly channel its potential.

* **Arcane Whisper**: While carrying the crucible, gain a **+1 item bonus to Crafting checks related to alchemy**.

* **Perfect Mixture** *(reaction)*: Once per day, when the alchemist rolls damage for an alchemical bomb, they may reroll the damage dice and take the higher result.

**Relic Progression (Gifts as it grows with the PC)
Minor Gifts**

* **Everburning Reagent**: The crucible counts as a **permanent alchemist’s fire reagent**. You may craft alchemist’s fire without expending infused reagents once per day.

* **Blood to Fuel**: Once per day, you can take 1d6 damage to immediately gain 1 additional infused reagent.

**Moderate Gifts**

* **Experimental Transmutation**: Once per day, you may transmute 1 mundane vial (water, oil, ale) into a random alchemical consumable of equal or lower level (GM rolls secretly).

* **Perfected Mixtures**: When using Quick Alchemy, one concoction you create per round lasts **2 rounds** instead of 1.

**Major Gifts**

* **Crucible of Gold**: Once per week, you can create a nugget of transmuted gold worth 50 gp. Doing so inflicts a creeping brand on your skin (a golden scar that never fades).

* **Philosopher’s Flame**: You gain the ability to throw a special relic bomb once per day — **Philosopher’s Fire** — a 20-ft. burst that deals moderate fire damage, but creatures reduced to 0 by it turn into brittle golden statues.

**Curse / Drawback**

* Each time you use a **Moderate or Major Gift**, roll a Will save (DC set by relic level). On a failure, whispers from the crucible urge you toward obsession with experimentation.
	* **Minor Failure**: Distracted — take a –1 penalty to Perception for 10 minutes.
	* **Major Failure**: The crucible consumes one of your infused reagents at random, even if you don’t use it.

**Lore**
The Ember Crucible is said to be the *final vessel* of the Emperor’s alchemist, forged from his laboratory cauldron and quenched in his own blood. His spirit lingers, eager to continue experiments through the hands of a new alchemist.

Would you like me to also **stat up the “Philosopher’s Fire” relic bomb** fully (damage dice, splash damage, persistent fire) in PF2e mechanics so it’s plug-and-play for your Alchemist PC?
